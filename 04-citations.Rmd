Here I'm going to include some discussion about what I can observe from the data.

Overall distribution
-   IU > gram > group

Gram Areal Patterns
- W Africa
- Near Oceania
- N/S America?
    - creoles with W African substrates

Group Areal patterns
- all in N Oceania
- linked to clause-demarcating use of boundary tones? (cf. Matukar Panau)

Structural patterns
- grouping with 'core' level SVCs
    - two IUs condensing into one?
- different gram patterns in different areas
    - constructional profile in N Oceania
    - tests in W Africa
- metatypy for gram?
- narrative SVCs/juxtaposition as source construction
- productivity varies between languages
- prosodic word vs. prosodic phrase
