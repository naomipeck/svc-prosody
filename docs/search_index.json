The final type of complement clause is an apparent paratactic construction.

In this construction, two fully inflected verbs appear one after the other without any kind of conjunction or complementizer, just as in two regularly juxtaposed clauses.

To be exact, the gram complies with the definitional characteristics of the prototype of a SVC – in each such case, it does so to a high extent: 1) The WZIĄĆ gram does not exhibit markers of syntactic dependency: subordination, embedding, and nominalization. 2) The WZIĄĆ gram does not exhibit markers of clause coordination. 3) The components (especially the minor verb wziąć) cannot be questioned, answered or replied separately. 4) The WZIĄĆ gram exhibits prosodic properties typical of a single clause rather than a sequence of clauses. The construction constitutes a single phrasal group with no intonation break between its components. 5) The WZIĄĆ gram exhibits a single polarity value. 6) The WZIĄĆ gram has a unitary TAM value and, consequently, the individual components cannot select TAM categories separately. 7) The WZIĄĆ gram is not limited to a few verbal categories of tense, aspect, mood, or voice. 8) Operators of time, space, manner, and instrument extend over the entire construction rather than individual components. The use of such operators for the two verbs separately is ungrammatical. 9) The components of the WZIĄĆ gram invariably and compulsorily share the subject argument. More generally, the WZIĄĆ gram disallows duplicate roles, be they core and peripheral arguments, or adjuncts. The total argument structure is never more complex than the argument structure of V2. 10) Outside the WZIĄĆ gram, the components of this construction are able to occur separately as independent verbs in their own clauses. (Andrason 2018, 618–19) The WZIĄĆ gram fully complies with the phonological property of SVCs – namely, a fully audible pause comparable to a break that separates coordinated clauses (both syndetically and asyndetically) is absent in the WZIĄĆ gram (Góralczyk 2010: 100, 103; Gębka-Wolak 2012: 54). For example, in (9), V1 and V2 are pronounced with no pause but rather as a single phonological phrase. In fact, the pause is absent even if some elements intervene between V1 and V2. (Andrason 2018, 587–88) The PÓJŚĆ gram is a bi-verbal construction whose components are finite; neither of these verbal components is syntactically dependent on the other; the formative verbs are not connected by a coordinator but rather form a single clause; the PÓJŚĆ gram exhibits a mono-clausal intonation with no pause separating V1 and V2; it also exhibits a single TAM value and a single polarity value; the components of the PÓJŚĆ gram are not marked by incompatible TAM categories; the gram is not restricted to a particular temporal or modal category, but appears in various TAM categories available in Polish; V1 and V2 share their subject argument and duplicate roles are disallowed; lastly, both verbs may occur on their own, thus exhibiting their respective lexical meanings.

(Kruspe 2004, 361–62) Clause concatenation is a string of two or more clauses, which a speaker chooses to represent as a string of events in a single unit under a single intonation contour. This construction is referred to as a sentence. Each clause within the sentence is marked off from the other clauses in the construction by a non-final pause.

Grammatical: 0 “A serial verb construction contains two or more verb roots neither that are compounded …nor members of separate clauses.” (Payne, 2006, p. 288). Serial verbs express various faces of one complex event. According to Payne, the difference of a prototypical serial verb from a coordinate clause construction is that in serial verb construction: 1. There is only one subject. 2. The tense/aspect marking is done only on one verb. 3. The intonation is characteristic of a single clause. (Payne, 2006, p. 289) Chabu [exhibits] serial verbs that fulfill the criteria discussed by Payne. Most of them are formed using a movement verb as first component and the verbs am ‘come’ or no ‘go’ as a second component of the serial. (Kibebe 2015, 327–28) …there is only one subject in each clause. In addition, tense, aspect and number markers are suffixed to only the second verb in the clause. In fact there is a helping auxiliary that precedes the first verb which hosts some person, tense and aspect markers. However, the auxiliary and the markers attached to the auxiliary do not repeat themselves before the second verb. … most Chabu serial verb constructions place the two verbs that constitute the serial in successive, adjacent position as compounded entities.

Grammatical: 1 Serialisation can be defined by the presence of two lexical roots serving as predicates within the same clause. In such constructions, any tense marking is expressed on the first verb, and the topic is resumed by a pronoun before the second constituent head. (Remijsen and Ayoker 2018, 51, footnote 22) A second example involves a serial verb construction. In (32), the topic of this clause is a woman called Apwodho. She is referenced before the first constituent verb in the serialisation (á-weekɪ ̀ ), and again, resumptively, by the pronoun ɛ́ , immediately before the second constituent verb, cʊ̂́ʊʊl ̄ , which is in Applicative voice. Apwodho constitutes the semantic role of Instrument, used to compensate the hippo, the semantic object that follows the verb.

Grammatical: 0 In (35) there are three clauses. The first two are linked without conjunction or drop in intonation, so that the pronoun referring to the subject of the second is phonologically suffixed to the subject enclitic of the first. This is the highest form of continuity possible between two events. The second two are linked only by a slight pause and drop in intonation, indicated by the period. (Willett 1991, 223) SET has a limited number of complex verb phrases that function as a complementation strategy. They have no overt subordination or coordination markers. These constructions exhibit the following properties of serial verb constructions: i) they share the same subject and markers of tense and aspect; ii) they contain two verbs without overt markers of coordination or subordination; iii) the verbs form a single predicate; iv) serialized verbs also occur alone in non-serial constructions; v) the negation particle cham has scope over the two verbs; vi) the adverb has scope over the two verbs; vii) there is no lexical or grammatical material between the verbs, with the exception of the cause-effect type; and viii) these predicates are not marked by the suffix -ji, which is a productive marker expressing dependency. (García Salido 2014, 141) Juxtaposition is often preferred in natural conjunction–that is, when the two conjuncts usually go together and form some kind of conceptual unit. In SET the lack of an overt coordinator may allow the encoding of a construction that is called a serial verb, where the two verbs in a sequence express one single event, as illustrated in (36) with the verbs ‘work’ and ‘plant.’ The two verbs in this construction do not show any kind of dependency.

Grammatical: ? Verb roots can be combined in compound verb stems like dewo- ‘to come across’ in (37) and in complex phrasal verbs like mógo-we-wo-re in (38). The verbs de- and wo- are phonologically and morphologically integratated in the compound verb dewo- but in phrasal verbs there is only phonological integration. For example, mógo- ‘to carry’ in (38) is phonologically one word with the inflected second verb. A sign that these phrasal verb combinations form phonological words is the stress pattern, the bare verb root attracts the main word stress and the second inflected verb receives secondary stress. Another sign is that the /m/ of the subject prefix me- is always realized by its intervocalic allophone [w]. The fact that the subject and object prefixes separale the bare verb form tile following inflected verb signals that there is no morphological integration of the two verbs, in contrast with compound verbs. Complex phrasal verbs frequently occur in the texts … both with two Inanwatan verbs and with a Malay loan or code mix followed by an inflected form of ge- ‘to do’.
