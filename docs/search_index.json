Core cosubordinate nexus is found in constructions known as verb serialization, in which two verbs sharing a common core argument are merely juxtaposed with no element intervening between them. (Gudai 1985, 284) In (3) the two juncts are merely juxtaposed with no overt coordinator occuring in between. This is known as paratactic construction, following Noonan and Bavin-Wood (1978). Paratactic coordinate construction seems to occur freely to replace the construction conjoined by the conjunction anri ‘and’. This conjunction is the least marked in the sense that it merely functions to conjoin two or more juncts. Coordinate constructions conjoined by anri or arranged paratactically may consist of more than two juncts as long as a pause (identical to a comma in written language) is provided between each two juncts.

This construction is somewhat fossilised, with only one of the particles that function as a minor verb in an asymmetrical SVC also occurring as an independent verb. (Stebbins 2011, 212) The term ‘clause chaining’ is also applicable to a specific sentence level syntactic construction in Mali in which strings of short clauses are marked with a distinctive tense pattern on the final verb. These clause chains typically refer to a series of actions that make up a larger event that can be viewed as a unified whole. The final verb in the chain is always in the present tense… (Stebbins 2011, 291–92) 4.86.3 Examples Stebbins (2011), 213, example 13.19 ## &lt;table class=&quot; lightable-minimal&quot; style=&#39;font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;, verdana, sans-serif; width: auto !important; &#39;&gt; ## &lt;tbody&gt; ## &lt;tr&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; Kama &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; me:ngga &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; sa &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; chave &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; re:n.se:cha &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; i &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;/tr&gt; ## &lt;tr&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; _kama_ &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; _me:ng-ka_ &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; _sa_ &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; _ka=pe_ &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; _the:n.se:=ka_ &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; _i_ &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;/tr&gt; ## &lt;tr&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;art&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; tree-&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;masc&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;sg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;nef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;3masc&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;sg&lt;/span&gt;=be_there &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; grow_well.&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;fut&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;3masc&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;sg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; because &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;/tr&gt; ## &lt;/tbody&gt; ## &lt;/table&gt; &lt;table class=&quot; lightable-minimal&quot; style=&#39;font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;, verdana, sans-serif; width: auto !important; border-bottom: 0;&#39;&gt; ## &lt;tbody&gt; ## &lt;tr&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; mali &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; cha &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; nangger. &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;/tr&gt; ## &lt;tr&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; _mali_ &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; _ka_ &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; _nangger_ &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;/tr&gt; ## &lt;tr&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; earlier &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;3masc&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;sg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; be_bent.&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;ni&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt; ## &lt;/tr&gt; ## &lt;/tbody&gt; ## &lt;tfoot&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;padding: 0; &quot; colspan=&quot;100%&quot;&gt; ## &lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &#39;The three is standing up where once (lit. &#39;because&#39;) it was bent.&#39;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tfoot&gt; ## &lt;/table&gt; Stebbins (2011), 292, example 18.24 De: tha the:k.nathe:vama chasesta… va tha thet ti ngim nani da ta the:k.ne:=athe:vama chases-ta va ta thet ti ngim nani and 3h.pl send.npres=3h.pl.poss spy-h.pl purp 3h.pl go.fut 3h.pl look.pres for chama arutha… kama a=ru-ta art spec=person-h.pl ‘And they sent their spies… to go out and look for people…’ References "],["manam.html", "4.87 Manam", " 4.87 Manam 4.87.1 Details Glottocode: mana1295 Family: Austronesian Macroarea: Papunesia 4.87.2 Coding IU: 1 Grouping: 1 Grammatical: 0 In our discussion of Manam sentence structures in this and the preceding chapters, we have encountered several constructions that exhibit an otherwise unusual characteristic: two verbs occur in sequence, and an argument of the second verb may precede the first verb, even though it is not an argument of that verb. (Lichtenberk 1983, 560) Two facts concerning the Manam constructions under discussion should now be noted: 1. The verbs in sequence may or may not be joined by be ‘and’: be is used in the vigorous action construction, it is not used in the ability constructions, and it is apparently optional in pseudo-purpose sentences. 2. The intonation patterns are those characteristic of complex sentences, i.e., a slight rise in intonation at the end of the first verb.

Grammatical: 0 Indeed, the notion of coverb itself can be conceived of as a construction or recurring pattern rather than a part of speech or word class. In the coverbial construction, a verb forms a compound predicate together with the next verb, or MAIN VERB, which means that they share a subject, and that the coverbial phrase provides additional details about the event expressed by the main verb. (Wiedenhof 2015, 134) Sentence (8) will not be taken to mean (2) my writing of a letter on his behalf (‘I am writing a letter for him’) unless realized with a intonational break signaling an afterthought construction (§3.4): Wó xiě xìn, gěi ta. ‘I am writing a letter; for him, that is.’ But like (7), this special prosodic pattern also allows for reading (1) ‘I am writing a letter; to him, that is.’.

Grammatical: 0 In a main verb + auxiliary construction, the main verb is nonfinite. There are six morphological possibilities. In many instances, the main verb appears as just a verb stem, with no morphology at all. … An auxiliary verb always follows the main verb. The auxiliary verb (the final one, if more than one is present in a particular clause) bears finite morphology, or, if the clause is dependent, it is the auxiliary verb which bears whatever nonfinite morphology is used to define the relationship between the clause and another clause, on which it is dependent.(Slater 2005, 132) In fact, it turns out that constructions of just these two types account for all of the appearances of nonfinite bare verb stems in Mangghuer. It would be possible to treat these two construction types as serializations, and this would certainly be commensurate with previous discussions of serial constructions. However, constructions of the first type can also be accounted for as instances of clause chaining, and we will see in this chapter that they fall naturally into the category of Mangghuer non-final clauses. Constructions of the second type have already been accounted for in Chapter 4, as verb + auxiliary constructions. Thus, although these Mangghuer constructions could be described as instances of serialization, I will describe them with other terms instead. (Slater 2005, 231) No such postposing of zero-marked non-final clauses is possible. These clauses rely on their position (preceding another clause) to give them a semantic interpretation (preceding the action of the other clause in time). The fact that zero-marked clauses cannot be postposed thus appears to be not a syntactic fact, but rather, simply a semantic fact. If the zero marker had more semantic content, as do some of the other markers we have seen, zero-marked clauses might also be postposable. However, due to the lack of semantic specificity which obtains when no suffix at all is used, linear positioning must bear an unusual semantic load, and postposing becomes impossible.
