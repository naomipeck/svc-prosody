Naomi Peck 2022-12-09 Abstract Serial verb constructions (SVCs) are commonly described as occurring within a single intonation unit (IU) following Givón 1991, leading to Himmelmann (2022) to assert that they are “IU-bounded constructions”. However, as of yet, there is no empirical study exploring the prosodic realisation of SVCs. In this poster, I show results from a first study into the prosody of serial verb constructions, based on a sample of grammatical descriptions from 150 languages with verb serialisation, accompanied with examples from spoken corpora. I find that serial verb constructions do not necessarily need to obey a “One Intonation Unit” constraint. Initial evidence suggests that we cannot claim that all SVCs are IU-bounded. Himmelmann’s claim presupposes that a) serial verb constructions are not grammatically robust, and that b) a serial verb construction will not be recognised as such when realised over multiple IUs. In fact, we find a mix of prosodically-dependent and prosodically-robust types across languages: while the majority of constructions appear to be IU-bounded, a number of constructions can be realised as prosodic groupings (prosodically-dependent constructions consisting of multiple IUs), and elsewhere SVCs can fulfil constituent tests typical of prosodically-robust, i.e. grammaticalised, constructions in other languages. It has been recognised for a while that the label of serial verb construction is used as an umbrella term for many different constructional subtypes (Foley 2010). My empirical investigation of the prosody of serial verb constructions shows similarly that the “single IU constraint” is not one-size-fits-all. Foley, William A. 2010.

"],["serial-verb-construction.html", "1.1 Serial Verb Construction", " 1.1 Serial Verb Construction A serial verb construction (SVC) is a grammatical unit which consists of two or more verbs which are juxtaposed without any marking of coordination or subordination. This construction has the same distribution as single verbs in the same language, and can be grammatically defined using the same criteria (although construction-specific criteria may also apply). The verbs within the construction should be able to be used as standalone predicates (i.e., as single verbs), albeit with a different but related meaning. "],["intonation-unit.html", "1.2 Intonation Unit", " 1.2 Intonation Unit An intonation unit can be defined both as a phonetic and as a phonological unit. As a phonetic unit, intonation units can be universally defined as units of speech (and potentially sign) which commence with a ‘pitch reset’ (Himmelmann et al. 2018). These units are often bounded by other cues, such as pauses, changes in tempo (lags/rushes), changes in voice quality (creaky/breathy), as well as intonational contour cues, such as boundary tones. Intonation units are the minimal unit in conversation, i.e. turns minimally consist of a single intonation unit (selting1996?), and are hypothesised to be the minimal unit of information packaging in human language (chafe1996?). As a phonological unit, intonation units must be defined on a language-specific basis with reference to lower phonological units within a language. Typically, intonation units can be the domain for (morpho-)phonological rules, and feature a unit-level accent and boundary tones. Given the universality of phonetic intonation units, as well as the universality of functions related to intonation unit-like units in speech, I assume that all languages have a phonological unit which corresponds to the phonetic intonation unit. It is important to additionally distinguish between intonation units and intonation contours. Intonation units create chunks of language, while intonation contours encode additional information (and contribute to the ability of the intonation unit to chunk). Contours are language-specific and can extend over multiple intonation units [reference]. As such, we cannot take discussions of intonation contours to equal discussions of intonation units. References "],["one-intonation-unit-constraint.html", "1.3 “One Intonation Unit” constraint", " 1.3 “One Intonation Unit” constraint The “One Intonation Unit” constraint refers more broadly to the hypothesis that all serial verb constructions must be realised within a single intonation unit. This constraint is a hypothesis which relies on a number of hypotheses and assumptions within functional-typological literature. Firstly, serial verb constructions are commonly assumed to encode a single event, due to their similar distribution to single verbs (e.g. Aikhenvald 2006; Bisang 2009). (pawley1985?) suggested that serial verb constructions actually can encode more than one event. Givón (1991) tested this hypothesis by using the proxy of breath groups for events, and found that the large majority of SVCs were realised within a single breath group. This finding was then taken more broadly to mean that all SVCs were realised in either a single intonation unit, or under a single intonation contour. However, (chafe1996?) hypothesised that no more than “one new idea” can be realised in a given intonation unit at a time, which would suggest that serial verb constructions - which realise ‘one event’ - should be realised within a single intonation unit. It additionally suggests, however, that discourse plays a role in how events are construed. The constraint as it is tested in this work takes the form of Himmelmann (2022)’s assertion that SVCs are “IU-bounded constructions”, i.e. the construction is only recogniseable as an SVC when it is realised within the same intonation unit.

Serialization requires the nonfinite form of verbs when the (causative or instrumental morpheme) verb ɔ ‘do’ is involved. Otherwise, it is just the bare form of verbs that occur in a sequence; in this case, the verbs involved are usually from the class of intransitives (i.e. they take no inflection in their finite form). In Apinajé, serialization always involves either a movement verb or a position verb. Not all verbs belonging to each category are eligible for serial constructions expressing aspectual meanings, but only a selected few. When verbs from outside this inventory are used, the resulting overall meaning of the construction is more literal than grammatical, sometimes yielding awkward or jocose meanings. (Cunha de Oliveira 2005, 275) From the prosodic point of view, the elements of each complex construction belong within a single sentential intonation contour. Morphologically, there is only one mode marker for the whole construction, such that all elements fall under its scope. In regard to syntax, boundary indices and the internally cohesive distribution of elements in the sentence are indicative of the internal coherence of serialization… (Cunha de Oliveira 2005, 276) 6.9.3 Examples Cunha de Oliveira (2005), 162, example 106d Pa tẽ tẽm. rl go fall ‘I fell.’ Cunha de Oliveira (2005), 161, example 106a Kɔt paj arĩ ic-krĩ irr 1.irr stay 1-sit ‘I’ll remain seated.’ References "],["arta.html", "6.10 Arta Ashéninka Perené", " 6.10 Arta 6.10.1 Details Glottocode: arta1239 Family: Austronesian Macroarea: Papunesia 6.10.2 Coding IU: 1 Grouping: 0 Grammatical: ? Sequential verb construction is the coordination in which the motion verbs such as (ma)ngay and (a)ngin are combined with another predicate. This construction prosodically constitutes a single intonation unit, with no intonation break between the two predicates involved. (kimoto2017?) Tight coordination is another type of clausal coordination, in which the whole constituent is pronounced in a single intonation contour and the absolutive arguments of both of the predicates should be co-referential. If the absolutive argument is realized in a full NP, it immediately follows the first predicate before the second predicate, with the second clause having no overt person index.

The more predicates in a sequence, the more difficult it is to tell. In rapid speech, which is very often employed by my consultants, and/or when the speaker becomes extremely engaged in and enthusiastic about the narrative, prosodic pauses get shorter and shorter to the extent that they become irrelevant.

Since there is no overt marking, intonation is the only means to identify conjoined units (Haspelmath, 2007: 7). (Balukh 2020, 230) Paratactic constructions also appear like SVCs in terms of the consecutive occurrence of verbs. An extreme sequence of verbs is shown in (76) below. It is a complement construction marked by the complementizer na (see §6.3.2.1). The matrix clause itself contains a SVC consisting of two verbs, pèci ‘to throw’ and the inflected verb mere ‘to take’. Furthermore, the complement clause has seven verbs that occur consecutively … It is difficult to determine SVCs in this construction, as there are no overt syntactic markings. Contributing to this difficulty is the fact that subject and object deletion is a common pattern in natural discourse in Dhao. As such, argument sharing is difficult to identify. After looking at the construction in detail, it appears that it has two separate clauses tied together. The first clause involves V1-V3, while the second clause involves V4-V7.

In the normal rate of speech serial verb constructions usually [emphasis NP] form a pitch phrase.

(Park 2012, 541) None of the elements in an unmarked serial construction are marked with ablaut-triggering contemporaneous suffixes if the semantics of the serialized construction encodes intent, desire, or purpose. The so-called purposive serial verb constructions anticipate future events, whereby the intended action follows the intent or motion encoded in the second verb.

Serialisation as described there consists of a lexical verb stem followed by one or more verb stems that are highly constrained and have mainly aspectual and other grammatical functions. The combination of these serialised verb stems is considered to constitute one word on the following grounds. First, there may be no pause between the stems and individual intonation contours of the stems is impossible. Second, the order of the serialised elements is strict. Third, the serialised stems share one set of verbal morphology and may not have individual arguments. (Seiler 1985, 194) To conclude this section: Imonda possesses no morphosyntactic means to co-ordinate independent clauses. Clauses may be simply juxtaposed without any formal link. Frequently, juxtaposed clauses are reduced, often containing nothing but a verb. However, sequences of such reduced clauses are not to be regarded as monoclausal as they may have individual intonation contours, individual tense/mood marking, and individual core arguments. Semantically they do not form a unity (unlike the Vagala example cited above), but rather depict consecutive events. As far as the term verb serialisation is concerned, in this grammar this term is restricted to those cases where the individual stems form a tightly knit unity with one set of verbal morphology (5.41, and is not used for cases of reduced clauses that are neither semantically, syntactically nor phonologically tightly bound. Juxtaposed clauses need not necessarily involve a verb at all, in which case the term ‘verb serialisation’ would be obviously inappropriate.

(Lane 2007, 1) It seems likely that the ease with which long stretches of material can intervene between SVC-initial motion stems and the following stem contributes to the possibility of ‘getting lost’ in this way. It is also possible for a speaker to pause when am- or ap- are followed by long NPs, either immediately after the verb stem itself or after the following NP. In contrast, there would be no pause in an SVC such as pak dad apl ‘hit carrying having-come’. The intervention of long stretches of non-verb material, and the concomitant possibility of a pause and of the recapitulation of the subject, are evidence of a weaker bond between motion verbs and the following stem(s) than the bond which usually holds between the stems of an SVC.

Each of the verbs receives its own stress, and thus is a separate phonological word, but the construction as a whole is expressed in one intonational unit. Verbs of a serial verb construction share their subjects and (if more than one member is transitive) objects. They also share adjuncts. They share all their morphology except object marking; all transitive verbs cross-reference their own objects. However, all other categories that can be marked on verbs (e.g. subject marking, TAM, polarity, valency changing, and other morphology) are marked only once on the predicate, and have scope over the whole predicate.

Such constructions, with two independent predicates occurring next to each other but not in a serial verb construction and with no overt relationship to each other, only occur with verbs tave and tuna; in all other cases, clauses in sequence must be overtly marked for their relationship with each other, either as subordinate-dependent or coordinate-dependent or coordinated independent clauses.

The verbs in sequence may or may not be joined by be ‘and’: be is used in the vigorous action construction, it is not used in the ability constructions, and it is apparently optional in pseudo-purpose sentences. 2. The intonation patterns are those characteristic of complex sentences, i.e., a slight rise in intonation at the end of the first verb.

In the coverbial construction, a verb forms a compound predicate together with the next verb, or MAIN VERB, which means that they share a subject, and that the coverbial phrase provides additional details about the event expressed by the main verb.

Grammatical: 0 In a main verb + auxiliary construction, the main verb is nonfinite. There are six morphological possibilities. In many instances, the main verb appears as just a verb stem, with no morphology at all. … An auxiliary verb always follows the main verb. The auxiliary verb (the final one, if more than one is present in a particular clause) bears finite morphology, or, if the clause is dependent, it is the auxiliary verb which bears whatever nonfinite morphology is used to define the relationship between the clause and another clause, on which it is dependent.(Slater 2005, 132) In fact, it turns out that constructions of just these two types account for all of the appearances of nonfinite bare verb stems in Mangghuer. It would be possible to treat these two construction types as serializations, and this would certainly be commensurate with previous discussions of serial constructions. However, constructions of the first type can also be accounted for as instances of clause chaining, and we will see in this chapter that they fall naturally into the category of Mangghuer non-final clauses. Constructions of the second type have already been accounted for in Chapter 4, as verb + auxiliary constructions. Thus, although these Mangghuer constructions could be described as instances of serialization, I will describe them with other terms instead. (Slater 2005, 231) No such postposing of zero-marked non-final clauses is possible. These clauses rely on their position (preceding another clause) to give them a semantic interpretation (preceding the action of the other clause in time). The fact that zero-marked clauses cannot be postposed thus appears to be not a syntactic fact, but rather, simply a semantic fact. If the zero marker had more semantic content, as do some of the other markers we have seen, zero-marked clauses might also be postposable. However, due to the lack of semantic specificity which obtains when no suffix at all is used, linear positioning must bear an unusual semantic load, and postposing becomes impossible.

Grammatical: 1 Sentences with multiple verbs are common in Nchane. Those which consist of clauses of equal status could possibly be described as serial verb constructions (henceforth SVCs)… There are no morphological or syntactic markers of clausal subordination or of support clause status, nor of clausal adjunction in either example. Subject marking is usually associated with each verb of a sequence. … the tense-marking strategy of the language [] usually establishes tense at discourse boundaries, with little or no tense marking for later sentences. (Boutwell 2020, 284–85) Prosodies represent another possible indicator to differentiate SVCs. However, prosodic elements in Nchane sentences are somewhat inconsistently realized. Clause boundaries are often marked by pauses, but this is not always the case. Example (194) presents multiple verbal elements with no apparent pause, change in intensity or tonal phenomena to mark a clause boundary. However, the two verbs may not be interpreted as encoding a single complex event, but rather two separate events in sequence. Thus, I interpret this sentence as comprised of two juxtaposed, independent clauses. … Conversely, some sentences with multiple verbs which seem to express a single event, and thus, representative of an SVC analysis, have clear pauses following the verbs. Such is the case in (195), which has a distinct pause following the verb ‘go’.

The serial unit conveys a single proposition. Syntactically, it consists not of two clauses, but of two predicates which share a single set of arguments.

The introduction of such would change the whole nature of the clause.

There is only one subject. 2. The tense/aspect marking is done only on one verb. 3. The intonation is characteristic of a single clause. (Payne, 2006, p. 289) Chabu [exhibits] serial verbs that fulfill the criteria discussed by Payne.

She is referenced before the first constituent verb in the serialisation (á-weekɪ ̀ ), and again, resumptively, by the pronoun ɛ́ , immediately before the second constituent verb, cʊ̂́ʊʊl ̄ , which is in Applicative voice.

This is the highest form of continuity possible between two events. The second two are linked only by a slight pause and drop in intonation, indicated by the period. (Willett 1991, 223) SET has a limited number of complex verb phrases that function as a complementation strategy. They have no overt subordination or coordination markers. These constructions exhibit the following properties of serial verb constructions: i) they share the same subject and markers of tense and aspect; ii) they contain two verbs without overt markers of coordination or subordination; iii) the verbs form a single predicate; iv) serialized verbs also occur alone in non-serial constructions; v) the negation particle cham has scope over the two verbs; vi) the adverb has scope over the two verbs; vii) there is no lexical or grammatical material between the verbs, with the exception of the cause-effect type; and viii) these predicates are not marked by the suffix -ji, which is a productive marker expressing dependency. (García Salido 2014, 141) Juxtaposition is often preferred in natural conjunction–that is, when the two conjuncts usually go together and form some kind of conceptual unit. In SET the lack of an overt coordinator may allow the encoding of a construction that is called a serial verb, where the two verbs in a sequence express one single event, as illustrated in (236) with the verbs ‘work’ and ‘plant.’ The two verbs in this construction do not show any kind of dependency.

The verbs de- and wo- are phonologically and morphologically integratated in the compound verb dewo- but in phrasal verbs there is only phonological integration. For example, mógo- ‘to carry’ in (238) is phonologically one word with the inflected second verb. A sign that these phrasal verb combinations form phonological words is the stress pattern, the bare verb root attracts the main word stress and the second inflected verb receives secondary stress. Another sign is that the /m/ of the subject prefix me- is always realized by its intervocalic allophone [w]. The fact that the subject and object prefixes separale the bare verb form tile following inflected verb signals that there is no morphological integration of the two verbs, in contrast with compound verbs.

In most cases, constructions that now resemble serial verb constructions are either the result of the loss of inflectional morphology, in particular the loss of the object prefix, or they are grammaticalised verbal elements that still show remnants of an erstwhile status as main predicates. Examples of the former are the expressions of manner and modality, examples of the latter are the verbal conjunctions and prepositions. Constructions with directional verbs, too, display some evidence for serialisation, but they are better characterised as simple clauses with adverbially used verbs (sections 10.14.2 and 10.14.4). Instances of ‘true serialisation’ are the constructions with aspectual verbs maleko ‘on and on’, sari ‘about to’ and jaga ‘often’, but it is noteworthy that two out of three of these verbs are Malay loan words. (van Staden 2000, 308) Paratactic constructions are characterised by a single intonation contour marking as one utterance a unit of more than one independent clause. By independent clause, I mean a finite clause with its own independent truth-values, i.e. it can be negated or modified independent of the other clause(s). The relation between the clauses is not overtly expressed. Iconicity in the relation of events in discourse and the context in which the utterance is placed suggest the relation between the clauses. (van Staden 2000, 278) The distinction between parataxis and serialisation is not always straightforward. In general the ‘tightly-knit’ paratactic constructions will be closest to serialisation. Neither parataxis nor serialisation use conjunctions, and the intonation of both is often like a single clause. In the case of parataxis, however, pauses and a non-final contour on the first clause are always possible, without significantly changing the interpretation, or the interpretation possibilities of the construction… (van Staden 2000, 280) 14.5.3 Examples van Staden (2000), 278, example 40 yeye polu gosa isa grandmother gather carry landwards ‘grandmother gathers and carries home (stones)’ van Staden (2000), 309, example 169 una wo-maleko wo-reke 3sg.masc 3sg.masc.a-continually 3sg.masc.a-cry ‘He cried on and on’ References "],["tommo-so-dogon.html", "14.6 Tommo So Dogon", " 14.6 Tommo So Dogon 14.6.1 Details Glottocode: tomm1242 Family: Dogon Macroarea: Africa 14.6.2 Coding IU: 1 Grouping: 0 Grammatical: 0 Tommo So makes great use of verb chaining, in which two (or more) verbal events are strung together with no overt subordinating morpheme. The events involved often come together to form a coherent whole (i.e. the actions are related), in which case they typically involve at least one consistent argument shared by all verbs in the chain; this argument is not necessarily the subject. In other cases, the verbs involved are not as tightly bound together, and the morphology of verb chaining is simply used to conjoin or subordinate clauses. (McPherson 2013, 441) If the verb is a regular, conjugating verb, a serial construction tends to be used to link the two phrases. There is no separate serial verb form of quasi-verbs.

The broad definition of an SVC applied here follows that of Haspelmath (ibid: 2) which states that an SVC is “a monoclausal construction consisting of multiple independent verbs with no element linking them and with no predicate-argument relation254 between the verbs”. In addition to this overarching feature, SVCs in Tondano also have the following characteristics (these are also considered characteristics of SVCs in Durie 1997:291, Aikhenvald 2006, Dixon 2006, and Noonan 2007:65, 88): - SVCs are comprised of multiple verbs which occur together within a clause. Other elements (e.g. conjunctions, negators, NPs, or PPs) do not occur between the two verbs. - The multiple verbs function as the head of a single predicate, and more importantly, they refer to a situation which is viewed as a single overall event. - Each verb in the SVC may also function independently as the sole verb in a verbal clause. - An SVC has only one shared pivot argument. (brickell2014?) Example (251) again displays two separate clauses, despite the absence of a co-ordinating conjunction. The reason this can only be an instance of parataxis is due to a number of features, these are: the pause in intonation between the two verbs, the difference in TAM marking ( is irrealis while meN- is realis), the separate representations of the PIV arguments, and the fact that there are two separate assertions (events) denoted by the verbal predicates. 14.7.3 Examples (brickell2014?), 425, example 772 komèa sumiwo litir manamèè? ko=&lt;um&gt;èa s&lt;um&gt;iwo litir mana=mèè 2sg.piv=&lt;av&gt;go &lt;av&gt;make dike there=dir.med.=&lt; ‘Will you go and build dikes over there?’ (brickell2014?), 427, example 776 ## Warning in matrix(for_matrix, nrow = nrow_matrix, byrow = TRUE): data length [10] is not a sub-multiple or ## multiple of the number of rows [3] sèa mupumou, èmengantangantar sèa &lt;um&gt;upu=mow sè=meN-CVCV-kantar 3sg &lt;av&gt;pick=cpl 3pl.piv=av.dyn-rdp-sing &lt; sèa mupumou, ‘They would pick (rice), they are singing.’ "],["toqabaqita.html", "14.8 Toqabaqita", " 14.8 Toqabaqita 14.8.1 Details Glottocode: toab1237 Family: Austronesian Macroarea: Papunesia 14.8.2 Coding IU: 1 Grouping: ?

Verb serialisation has been identified a distinctive feature of the Kx’a and Tuu language families (Güldemann &amp; Vossen 2000), and “lexically complex predicates” (cf. Güldemann 2006, Güldemann &amp; Fehn, forthc.) are known to exist in all known Khoisan languages… I will not follow Kilian-Hatz (2006, 2008, 2013) and Haacke (2014) who refer to them as “serial verb constructions” (SVC). … I will refer to them as “juncture-verb constructions” (JVC) instead. (fehn2014?) It may therefore be assumed that synchronically, the juncture is not an active marker in Ts’ixa, and that marking of active voice is not its function in the complex predicates under discussion. Its main function appears to lie in conveying that a verb will be followed by another verbal element – either a full verb or a suffix of verbal origin. All derivative suffixes and two of the three ANTERIOR / PAST suffixes requiring use of the juncture can be shown to have grammaticalised from a verbal source. One may therefore think of the juncture as an element putting verbs into a “construct state” (T. Güldemann, p.c.). Although this function does not coincide with an outright co- or subordination marker, more prototypical SVCs, e.g., those found in Western African languages or in the Kx’a and Tuu families, feature two or more full verbs which do not require any linking element between them.
