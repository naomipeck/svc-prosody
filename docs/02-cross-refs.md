# Rationale

Here I'm going to write something about why I'm doing this study.

This will relate to this part of the abstract:
Serial verb constructions (SVCs) are commonly described as occurring within a single intonation unit (IU) following Givón 1991, leading to Himmelmann (2022) to assert that they are “IU-bounded constructions”. However, as of yet, there is no empirical study exploring the prosodic realisation of SVCs.
