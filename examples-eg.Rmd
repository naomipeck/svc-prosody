> Intonation is an important factor in recognising SVCs, and in distinguishing them from conjoined clauses. While in many cases the only possible reading for a particular clause requires that it be recognised as containing an SVC, in numerous other cases ambiguity could arise, if it were not for the fact that the clause boundaries were indicated by intonation. Sentences \ref(@eambae1) and \ref(@eambae2) are minimal pairs which can only be distinguished by the difference in intonation. The comma in these sentences indicates the clause boundary. As discussed in §10.6.3.1.1, *rovo* 'finish' has two different functions apart from its function as an independent verbal predicate. Sentence \ref(@eambae1) contains two clauses, the first of which is an example of aspectual serialisation (§10.6.3.1), where *rovo* indicates completive aspect. Sentence \ref(@eambae2) is not an example of an SVC, but here *rovo* has a discourse function in linking clauses, expressing the fact that 'after' the event ofthe first clause, another event occurred.

> Verbs containing SVCs characteristically have the same intonational properties as do mono-verbal clauses. Taba declarative clauses generally have a falling intonation over the last elements of the clause and speakers frequently pause at their completion. This is characteristic of clauses containing SVCs just as it is of clauses containing monoverbal clauses. Contrast \ref(@taba1), showing the characteristic intonation associated with a serial verb clause with that shown in \ref(@taba2) which is an example of simple clause chaining, showing juxtaposed clauses.

> Verb serialization (in the strict V1V2 sense) is a fairly rare phenomenon in East Uvean, although it is quite grammatical and accepted as such by native speakers. It is rare, because there is a strong tendency in this language to prefer one predicate utterance followed by a nominalization, rather than twohead predications (see 2.3). In my entire text corpus (more than thirty hours of recordings), I only found some thirty occurrences of SVCs, most of them involving specialization (see 2.2, 2.4 and 2.5).

> When a complementtaking verb is followed by another verb with the same subject as its complement, incomplete sharing of inflection occurs. ... In such constructions, V1 is fully inflected as normally for person agreement and TAM. Whatever the aspect of V1, V2 is in the imperfective aspect, that is, it has final stress and carries the IMPF suffix –aa where expected (whenever another suffix or enclitic attaches outside it, mostly with first plural or second subjects or objects). The imperfective stem thus seems to function here like an infinitival or participial form, in a language which otherwise makes no use of non-finite forms. Tense and person marking on V2 have some degree of optionality. [@mcfarland2009, 200]

> There are a number of features that characterise serialisation in Gayo. Firstly, the verbs share a single subject NP, and the entire construction takes a single intonation contour. The two verbs represent two separate predicates, which can be separated by their shared subject. Unlike paratactic constructions (§16.5) the two verbs are not separated by a pause, and neither are the verbs marked by a conjunction, as is the case with subordination (§16.1). [@eades2005, 136]
