# Implications

Here I'm going to write about what the outcomes of my study are and what this means more broadly for the field.

- not all SVCs need to be realised in single intonation units
    - tendency rather than a rule
    - bc many constructions are discourse-dependent
- different profiles of SVCs in different areas of the world
    - robust constructions in W Africa
    - templatic construction in N Oceania
    - prosodic groupings in N Oceania
    - word-level constructions in Americas
- difference between nuclear and core constructions?
    - grouping only for core

yet unclear
- how pausing/hesitation/repairs interact with word-level phenomena
- how much pausing can be tolerated - gradient?
- role of intonation (contours) in signalling a construction
- to what extent are constructions discourse-dependent
- corpus searches
- psychological reality
- role of areality/contact
