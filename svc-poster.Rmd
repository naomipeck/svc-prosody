Serial verb constructions (SVCs) are commonly described as occurring within a single intonation unit (IU) following @givon1991, leading to @himmelmann2022 to assert that they are "IU-bounded constructions". However, as of yet, there is no empirical study exploring the prosodic realisation of SVCs. In this poster, I show results from a first study into the prosody of serial verb constructions, based on a sample of grammatical descriptions from 150 languages with verb serialisation, accompanied with examples from spoken corpora. I find that serial verb constructions do not necessarily need to obey a “One Intonation Unit” constraint.

Initial evidence suggests that we cannot claim that all SVCs are IU-bounded. Himmelmann's claim presupposes that a) serial verb constructions are not grammatically robust, and that b) a serial verb construction will not be recognised as such when realised over multiple IUs. In fact, we find a mix of prosodically-dependent and prosodically-robust types across languages: while the majority of constructions appear to be IU-bounded, a number of constructions can be realised as prosodic groupings (prosodically-dependent constructions consisting of multiple IUs), and elsewhere SVCs can fulfil constituent tests typical of prosodically-robust, i.e. grammaticalised, constructions in other languages.

It has been recognised for a while that the label of serial verb construction is used as an umbrella term for many different constructional subtypes [@foley2010]. My empirical investigation of the prosody of serial verb constructions shows similarly that the “single IU constraint” is not one-size-fits-all.

# Definitions

> Defining serial verb constructions is a sticky business. [@lord1993, 1]

## Serial Verb Construction

A serial verb construction (SVC) is a grammatical unit which consists of two or more verbs which are juxtaposed without any marking of coordination or subordination. This construction has the same distribution as single verbs in the same language, and can be grammatically defined using the same criteria (although construction-specific criteria may also apply). The verbs within the construction should be able to be used as standalone predicates (i.e., as single verbs), albeit with a different but related meaning.

Note that I do not operationalise a prototype approach to serial verb constructions like @aikhenvald2006, nor do I use an 'event-first' understanding to serial verb constructions pace @bisang2009. In this study, I rely on morphosyntactic characteristics such as agreement indexing and distribution of verbs and markers to identify potential serial verb constructions. 

## Intonation Unit

An intonation unit can be defined both as a phonetic and as a phonological unit. As a phonetic unit, intonation units can be universally defined as units of speech (and potentially sign) which commence with a 'pitch reset' [@himmelmannetal2018]. These units are often bounded by other cues, such as pauses, changes in tempo (lags/rushes), changes in voice quality (creaky/breathy), as well as intonational contour cues, such as boundary tones. Intonation units are the minimal unit in conversation, i.e. turns minimally consist of a single intonation unit [@selting1996], and are hypothesised to be the minimal unit of information packaging in human language [@chafe1994].
As a phonological unit, intonation units must be defined on a language-specific basis with reference to lower phonological units within a language. Typically, intonation units can be the domain for (morpho-)phonological rules, and feature a unit-level accent and boundary tones.
Given the universality of phonetic intonation units, as well as the universality of functions related to intonation unit-like units in speech, I assume that all languages have a phonological unit which corresponds to the phonetic intonation unit.

It is important to additionally distinguish between intonation *units* and intonation *contours*. Intonation units create chunks of language, while intonation contours encode additional information (and contribute to the ability of the intonation unit to chunk). As opposed to the omnipresence of intonation units, intonation contours are language-specific and can extend over multiple intonation units [@cruttenden1997; @ladd2008]. As such, discussions of intonation contours should not be interpreted as equivalent to those of intonation units.

## "One Intonation Unit" constraint

The "One Intonation Unit" constraint refers to the hypothesis that all serial verb constructions must be realised within a single intonation unit. This constraint is a hypothesis which relies on a number of hypotheses and assumptions within functional-typological literature. 

Firstly, serial verb constructions are commonly assumed to encode a single event, due to their similar distribution to single verbs [e.g. @aikhenvald2006; @bisang2009].
@pawley1987 suggested that serial verb constructions actually can encode more than one event.
@givon1991 tested this hypothesis by using the proxy of breath groups (stretches of speech between pauses) for events, and found that the large majority of SVCs were realised within a single breath group. This finding was then taken more broadly to mean that all SVCs were realised in either a single intonation unit, or under a single intonation contour.
However, @chafe1994 hypothesised that no more than "one new idea" can be realised in a given intonation unit at a time, which would suggest that serial verb constructions - if they realise only 'one event' - could be realised within a single intonation unit, but that it would be possible for SVCs to be encoded over multiple intonation units if more new information is to be encoded. It additionally suggests that discourse plays a role in how events are construed.

The constraint as it is tested in this work takes the form of @himmelmann2022's assertion that SVCs are "IU-bounded constructions", i.e. a construction is only recognisable as an SVC when it is realised within the same intonation unit. 

<!--chapter:end:01-intro.Rmd-->

# Background


The struggle to define the serial verb construction (SVC) has led researchers to focus on finding commonalities which hold across a wide variety of languages.
A general consensus holds that a SVC consists of a string of two verbs acting as a single unit.
Most definitions additionally include the conditions of monoclausality [e.g. @dechaine1993, 799; @foleyolson1985, 18-32], a lack of overt marking between verbal elements within the construction [e.g. @foleyolson1985, 18; @collins1997, 462] and single eventhood [e.g. @durie1997; @aikhenvald2006, 3; @bisang2009]. Other potential restrictions include that the verbal elements must be able to be used as independent predicates elsewhere [e.g. @aikhenvald2006, 3; @haspelmath2016, 302-304], the construction is realised under a single intonation contour or within a single intonation unit [e.g. @givon1991; @bradshaw1993], and that at least one argument must be shared by the verbs within the construction [e.g. @baker1989; @sebba1987].

Some linguists do not consider the presence of any linking morphemes within the construction [@zwicky1990; @haspelmath2016], while others allow it, given that the marker does not indicate dependency of any sort [@aikhenvald2018, 3; @foleyolson1985; @foley2010]. 
Similarly, @crowley1987's 'ambient serialisation', where the state of affairs expressed by the first verbal element acts as the subject of the second verbal element, is accepted as a SVC by many [e.g. @aikhenvald2006], but rejected by others [e.g. @cleary-kemp2015; @haspelmath2016].

There is additionally a split in how results of a number of syntactic constituent tests are treated.
Aikhenvald [-@aikhenvald2018, 1] states that constituent verbal elements within an SVC cannot be extracted, separately negated or questioned, or used independently as the answer to a question.
Bisang [-@bisang2009, 796] explicitly allows for separate focusing of elements, but does not address other constituent tests; Sebba similarly allows for independent focusing and clefting of constituent elements [-@sebba1987, 65-71], while disallowing separate negation [-@sebba1987, 89]. Foley and Olson, on the other hand, allow for variation in the scope and marking of negation [-@foleyolson1985, 28; @foley2010, 102].

> ...while verbal-subject serial verbs can never be separated from the verbs they modify by an intonation break or a conjunction, ambient-subject serial verbs can, with no appreciable effet on grammaticality or basic meaning. (In that case, they can strictly speaking no longer be considered serialized.) [@bradshaw1993, 157]

---

We can link much of the theoretical debate over the definition of the serial verb construction back to one important issue: namely, if an SVC can constitute a legitimate grammatical construction or not. 
This point is anticipated by @himmelmann2022 when he argues that serial verb constructions are intonation unit-bounded, i.e. that a construction is only recognisable as an SVC when it is realised within a single intonation unit.
Only prosodically-robust, i.e. syntactic, constructions can undergo grammatical diagnostic tests such as substitution or extraction. 
These are the only constructions which are able to 'project'^[Note that I use 'project' here in an emergent/interactional sense, whereby the use of a given construction anticipates or foreshadows the upcoming use of a unit of language [cf. @auer2005a].] syntactic structures which persist over prosodic breaks and allow for incremental or reformulated realisations [cf. @hopperthompson2008].
All other constructions are prosodically dependent, whether they be IU-bounded or prosodic groupings (multi-IU constructions, such as lists).
The fact that a single intonation unit or contour is often cited as a criterion for SVCs suggests that these constructions, too, have not been fully grammaticalised.

There has been little comparative work investigating the prosodic realisation of serial verb constructions which could help shed light upon this issue. 
@givon1991's seminal study investigated the distribution of serial verbs across breath groups in four languages of Papua New Guinea, arguing that the distribution was similar to that of single lexemes.
He did not look at pauses occurring within serial verb constructions.
@unterladstetter2019 argues for the need to integrate prosodic analysis and discourse information management to understand the distribution of the kinds of multi-verbal constructions seen in Eastern Indonesia.
A theoretical accounting for different prosodic outputs of serialisation is put forward in @tylerkastner2022 from a generative perspective.
No wide-scale survey of the prosody of verb serialisation exists.

# Overview of Data

```{r map-setup, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
#library(linguisticsdown)
#linguisticsdown::writeIPA()
library(lingtypology)
library(tidyverse)
```

I manually coded 150 languages with serial verb constructions for the presence or absence of the three different construction types posed by @himmelmann2022: IU-bounded, prosodic groupings, and grammatical (prosodically-robust). This information was taken from grammatical descriptions, with additional inspection of audio data when available.

All languages were assumed to be able to realise SVCs within single intonation units, due to the nature of an IU being the smallest realisation of a turn in interaction [@selting1996].

Languages were judged to have prosodically-grouped SVCs if a serial verb construction was realised over two adjacent intonation units with a robust language-specific contour.

Languages were judged to have prosodically robust SVCs based on a few kinds of evidence. The first set of evidence comes from grammatical diagnostic tests. If arguments could be extracted out of the SVC, the construction was considered as grammaticalised. Similarly, if separate verbs could be focussed, the construction was considered grammaticalised. The other type of evidence is constructional templates. For a SVC to be considered prosodically-robust under this condition, the SVC must have a distinct construction type in a given language which could not be construed as a different construction if a pause were to occur mid-construction.

The distribution of construction possibilities across the data set can be seen in Figure \@(#map).

> Serialization requires the nonfinite form of verbs when the (causative or instrumental morpheme) verb *ɔ* ‘do’ is involved. Otherwise, it is just the bare form of verbs that occur in a sequence; in this case, the verbs involved are usually from the class of intransitives (i.e. they take no inflection in their finite form). In Apinajé, serialization always involves either a movement verb or a position verb. Not all verbs belonging to each category are eligible for serial constructions expressing aspectual meanings, but only a selected few. When verbs from outside this inventory are used, the resulting overall meaning of the construction is more literal than grammatical, sometimes yielding awkward or jocose meanings.

In contrast, verbal compounds, where two verb stems (i.e. roots with verbal tone melodies) join to form a single complex verb stem, the entirety of which is surrounded by inflectional prefixes and suffixes, are more commonly attested.

They can be either clauses coordinated by juxtaposition in the same sentence or different juxtaposed sentences. In such cases, there are only prosodic clues to their status, mainly provided by pause and intonation, but the distinctions are many times blurred by the rapidity of speech and the degree of engagement of the speaker. The more predicates in a sequence, the more difficult it is to tell. In rapid speech, which is very often employed by my consultants, and/or when the speaker becomes extremely engaged in and enthusiastic about the narrative, prosodic pauses get shorter and shorter to the extent that they become irrelevant. Moreover, even in moderate velocity speech, prosodic pauses often do not coincide with breathing pauses. In rapid or very rapid speech, while one can still distinguish a sort of list intonation as the events are mentioned, a clearly distinguishable pause will occur only once the speaker is out of breath and, almost always, that does not express prosodic information.

> One fundamental criterion according to which all serial predicate constructions can be classified into one of two groups is finite marking: Depending on the non-initial predicate, some SPCs contain only one TAM marker (single marking), while in others, each predicate is preceded by its own TAM marker (multiple marking). Subject pronouns are never allowed in a non-initial predicate, the TAM marker always takes its monosyllabic form, as with third person singular subjects (see also section 5.1). [@vonprince2012, 304]

> Paratactic constructions also appear like SVCs in terms of the consecutive occurrence of verbs. An extreme sequence of verbs is shown in \ref(@dhao2) below.

The matrix clause itself contains a SVC consisting of two verbs, *pèci* ‘to throw’ and the inflected verb *mere* ‘to take’. Furthermore, the complement clause has seven verbs that occur consecutively ... It is difficult to determine SVCs in this construction, as there are no overt syntactic markings. Contributing to this difficulty is the fact that subject and object deletion is a common pattern in natural discourse in Dhao. As such, argument sharing is difficult to identify. After looking at the construction in detail, it appears that it has two separate clauses tied together. The first clause involves V1-V3, while the second clause involves V4-V7. It is shown that they have separate subjects, even though the different subjects refer to the same referent. ... the complement clause covers only the first clause in this construction, while the second clause is a separate clause that designates another follow-up event, which is the event that takes place after another event (fetch). ... There still are two sequence of verbs, *lami madhutu* ‘go to fetch’ and *la’e tenge* ‘go to look for’. In turn, these will not be considered as SVCs either, due to their predicate-argument relation.

> Intonation is an important factor in recognising SVCs, and in distinguishing them from conjoined clauses. While in many cases the only possible reading for a particular clause requires that it be recognised as containing an SVC, in numerous other cases ambiguity could arise, if it were not for the fact that the clause boundaries were indicated by intonation. Sentences \ref(@eambae1) and \ref(@eambae2) are minimal pairs which can only be distinguished by the difference in intonation. The comma in these sentences indicates the clause boundary. As discussed in §10.6.3.1.1, *rovo* 'finish' has two different functions apart from its function as an independent verbal predicate. Sentence \ref(@eambae1) contains two clauses, the first of which is an example of aspectual serialisation (§10.6.3.1), where *rovo* indicates completive aspect. Sentence \ref(@eambae2) is not an example of an SVC, but here *rovo* has a discourse function in linking clauses, expressing the fact that 'after' the event ofthe first clause, another event occurred.

In such constructions, V1 is fully inflected as normally for person agreement and TAM. Whatever the aspect of V1, V2 is in the imperfective aspect, that is, it has final stress and carries the IMPF suffix –aa where expected (whenever another suffix or enclitic attaches outside it, mostly with first plural or second subjects or objects).

> While a Haruai clause can contain at most one morphologically marked verb, many Haruai clauses contain more than one verb, these are serial verb constructions... Note that in the Haruai serial verb construction, it is always the last verb that shows morphological marking. [@comrie1995, 28]

> There is one further observation that needs to be made concerning the interpretation of morphological marking on verbs. In the third person singular of the present tense, Haruai has a zero inflection. In positive declarative sentences, the verb is nonetheless marked, by the declarative suffix *-a*. In interrogative or negative sentences, however, there is no declarative suffix, and the verb thus appears overtly in the same form as nonfinal verbs in a serial verb construction, as in \ref(@haruai2). ...

> There are two types of serial verb constructions in Hidatsa. In the first type (the majority of cases), except for the final verb in the sequence, all preceding component-verbs are marked with the contemporaneous suffix that triggers ablaut on the immediately preceding vowel. In the other type, the nonfinal verbs are not marked with the contemporaneous suffix and so do not ablaut. ... Subjects of verbs in serial verb constructions are coreferential and, with the exception of component-verbs that precede motion verbs in unmarked serial constructions, usually marked with pronominal prefixes. In the normal rate of speech serial verb constructions *usually* [emphasis NP] form a pitch phrase. [@park2012, 538-539]

> Contemporaneous serial verb constructions are always paraphrasable into two clauses that are then conceptualized as two separate events; i.e., replacing the contemporaneous suffix with the coordinative suffix yields two clauses that are conceptualized as two separate events (typically, events in sequence). [@park2012, 541]

> None of the elements in an unmarked serial construction are marked with ablaut-triggering contemporaneous suffixes if the semantics of the serialized construction encodes intent, desire, or purpose. The so-called purposive serial verb constructions anticipate future events, whereby the intended action follows the intent or motion encoded in the second verb. [@park2012, 544]

> Serial verb constructions in Hinuq consist of two juxtaposed verbs which act together as a single predicate. The first verb appears only as a stem without any further suffixes but retains its agreement prefixes. The second verb takes all inflectional and derivational suffixes that apply to the whole complex. ... Many serial verbs belong to the semantic domain of verbs of motion and physical actions, but they cannot be characterized by other semantic criteria (e.g. they do not follow iconic principles, they do not denote culturally important concatenations of events). Serial verbs cannot be regarded as morphosyntactic devices (except for those expressing causative constructions). [@forker2013, 697]

> Nakh-Daghestanian languages do not belong to the languages that are generally known to employ verb serialization. Nevertheless, Hinuq serial verb constructions match well with Aikhenvald’s (2006) definition. They always consist of two verbs that together form a single predicate and have one single intonation contour. The two verbs are phonologically independent words, but they form one grammatical word, as can be seen by the argument structure and the agreement. Serial verbs share all arguments and modifiers and the agreement. [@forker2013, 702]

> Serialisation as described there consists of a lexical verb stem followed by one or more verb stems that are highly constrained and have mainly aspectual and other grammatical functions. The combination of these serialised verb stems is considered to constitute one word on the following grounds. First, there may be no pause between the stems and individual intonation contours of the stems is impossible. Second, the order of the serialised elements is strict. Third, the serialised stems share one set of verbal morphology and may not have individual arguments. [@seiler1985, 194]

> To conclude this section: Imonda possesses no morphosyntactic means to co-ordinate independent clauses. Clauses may be simply juxtaposed without any formal link. Frequently, juxtaposed clauses are reduced, often containing nothing but a verb. However, sequences of such reduced clauses are not to be regarded as monoclausal as they may have individual intonation contours, individual tense/mood marking, and individual core arguments. Semantically they do not form a unity (unlike the Vagala example cited above), but rather depict consecutive events. As far as the term verb serialisation is concerned, in this grammar this term is restricted to those cases where the individual stems form a tightly knit unity with one set of verbal morphology (5.41, and is not used for cases of reduced clauses that are neither semantically, syntactically nor phonologically tightly bound. Juxtaposed clauses need not necessarily involve a verb at all, in which case the term 'verb serialisation' would be obviously inappropriate. [@seiler1985, 196-197]

> The following criteria are diagnostic of serial verb constructions in Kéo: <br>
1. A serial verb construction contains two or more verbs, which occur in the same clause describing a single event; <br> 
2. The whole serial verb complex is negated by a negator preceding the first verb (see 12.6.1);<br> 
3. All verbs come under the scope of one aspect or mood particle (see 12.2 and 12.3) which precedes the verb complex;<br> 
4. All verbs share a single subject, at the surface level;<br> 
5. The construction falls under the one intonation contour. That is, there are no pauses between the verbs in a serial construction. [@baird2002, 286-287]

> Based on auditory analysis, the verb complex falls under the one intonation contour. Therefore, in fluent speech there are no pauses with a grammatical function between contiguous verbs in serial verb constructions.<br>
Intonation does not fall nor rise on non-final verbs in a serial verb complex. A break in intonation, either in the form of a marked rise or fall on a non-final verb in a series, indicates that the verbs belong to different clauses. [@baird2002, 291]

> Serial verb constructions consist of two or, rarely, three verbs in juxtaposition, functioning as a single predicate, with no morphology to mark their relationship with each other. Each of the verbs receives its own stress, and thus is a separate phonological word, but the construction as a whole is expressed in one intonational unit. Verbs of a serial verb construction share their subjects and (if more than one member is transitive) objects. They also share adjuncts. They share all their morphology except object marking; all transitive verbs cross-reference their own objects. However, all other categories that can be marked on verbs (e.g. subject marking, TAM, polarity, valency changing, and other morphology) are marked only once on the predicate, and have scope over the whole predicate.

> In \ref(@maanyan3) the two juncts are merely juxtaposed with no overt coordinator occuring in between. This is known as paratactic construction, following Noonan and Bavin-Wood (1978).

This conjunction is the least marked in the sense that it merely functions to conjoin two or more juncts. Coordinate constructions conjoined by *anri* or arranged paratactically may consist of more than two juncts as long as a pause (identical to a comma in written language) is provided between each two juncts.

> In a main verb + auxiliary construction, the main verb is nonfinite. There are six morphological possibilities. In many instances, the main verb appears as just a verb stem, with no morphology at all. ...
An auxiliary verb always follows the main verb. The auxiliary verb (the final one, if more than one is present in a particular clause) bears finite morphology, or, if the clause is dependent, it is the auxiliary verb which bears whatever nonfinite morphology is used to define the relationship between the clause and another clause, on which it is dependent.[@slater2005, 132]

> In fact, it turns out that constructions of just these two types account for all of the appearances of nonfinite bare verb stems in Mangghuer. It would be possible to treat these two construction types as serializations, and this would certainly be commensurate with previous discussions of serial constructions. However, constructions of the first type can also be accounted for as instances of clause chaining, and we will see in this chapter that they fall naturally into the category of Mangghuer non-final clauses. Constructions of the second type have already been accounted for in Chapter 4, as verb + auxiliary constructions. Thus, although these Mangghuer constructions could be described as instances of serialization, I will describe them with other terms instead. [@slater2005, 231]

> No such postposing of zero-marked non-final clauses is possible. These clauses rely on their position (preceding another clause) to give them a semantic interpretation (preceding the action of the other clause in time). The fact that zero-marked clauses cannot be postposed thus appears to be not a syntactic fact, but rather, simply a semantic fact. If the zero marker had more semantic content, as do some of the other markers we have seen, zero-marked clauses might also be postposable. However, due to the lack of semantic specificity which obtains when no suffix at all is used, linear positioning must bear an unusual semantic load, and postposing becomes impossible.

This kind of sequence differs from asyndetic coordination in the following ways: a) only the motion verb can take an optional aspect or irrealis prefix; b) the second verb is only marked for subject, but it can receive an instrument prefix if it is a transitive verb; c) a distinct pause does not occur between the verbs. [@gravelle2004, 238]

> In addition to the omission of conjunctions, Meyah also has a tendency to omit direct objects and prepositional phrases when they are established in the discourse. The omission of conjunctions and arguments results in juxtaposed verb constructions. A pause between verbs (indicated by a slant line) marks the clause boundary. [@gravelle2004, 236-237]

> Relevant diagnostic and classificatory criteria for SVCs in Momu include (1) concordant or shared subject marking and TAM marking; (2) the absence of marking of coordination or subordination, and the absence of sequence marking particles or expressions; (3) lexemic status; (4) the absence of participants (especially non-subject participants); and (5) the ordering of participants such that they precede verbs that do not license them. <br>
Shared subject marking on the final verb indicates that the verbs or verb phrases are not coordinated. [@honeyman2016, 418]

> In \ref(@momu1) three verbs combine in an SVC. Again, these verbs are tightly bound. The first two verbs *pwe(n)* ‘come’ and *pana(i)* ‘get one’ show a degree of predictable truncation (§2.5.3). As a further indication of the tightness of the combining verbs, the argument (*fyi* ‘water’) common to the second verb *pana(i)* ‘get one’ and third verb *kiy* ‘consume’ occurs before the first verb *pwe(n)* ‘come’. In \ref(@momu3) on the other hand, despite the shared subject, these are better considered coordinated clauses as reflected by the pause, the lack of truncation of *pi(n)* and to a lesser degree the position of the object argument adjacent to the verb that licenses it.

> Sentences with multiple verbs are common in Nchane. Those which consist of clauses of equal status could possibly be described as serial verb constructions (henceforth SVCs)... There are no morphological or syntactic markers of clausal subordination or of support clause status, nor of clausal adjunction in either example. Subject marking is usually associated with each verb of a sequence. ... the tense-marking strategy of the language [] usually establishes tense at discourse boundaries, with little or no tense marking for later sentences. [@boutwell2020, 284-285]

> Prosodies represent another possible indicator to differentiate SVCs. However, prosodic elements in Nchane sentences are somewhat inconsistently realized. Clause boundaries are often marked by pauses, but this is not always the case. Example \ref(@ncane1) presents multiple verbal elements with no apparent pause, change in intensity or tonal phenomena to mark a clause boundary. However, the two verbs may not be interpreted as encoding a single complex event, but rather two separate events in sequence. Thus, I interpret this sentence as comprised of two juxtaposed, independent clauses. ... Conversely, some sentences with multiple verbs which seem to express a single event, and thus, representative of an SVC analysis, have clear pauses following the verbs. Such is the case in \ref(@ncane2), which has a distinct pause following the verb ‘go’. [@boutwell2020, 286]

> The final type of complement clause is an apparent paratactic construction. Again, the first verbs which occur in this type of construction are a restricted set: *gɛnɛ́ye* ‘to go’, *biyɛ́ye* ‘to come’, and *sikɛ́ye* ‘to repeat'. In this construction, two fully inflected verbs appear one after the other without any kind of conjunction or complementizer, just as in two regularly juxtaposed clauses. Semantically, however, they are tightly bound together. [@reader1998, 83-84]

> SVCs in Pnar ... are composed of two verbal elements which occur together in a way that allows both verbs to affect the semantics of the verbal event. The two verbal elements generally occur side by side as a single element... 
In the case of SVCs without a clear head, neither verb root receives affixation, whereas in SVCs with a clear head, the head verb is (or can be) affixed. When the first verb can receive affixation, there seem to be no clear restrictions on what verbs can occur as the second element. When the second verb can receive affixation the first element tends to be a ‘light’ verb or auxiliary. [@ring2015,439]

> The evidence demonstrates that the WZIĄĆ gram can be regarded as a SVC, relatively close to the cross-linguistic prototype postulated by Aikhenvald and Dixon (2006) and Bisang (2009). To be exact, the gram complies with the definitional characteristics of the prototype of a SVC – in each such case, it does so to a high extent: <br>
1) The WZIĄĆ gram does not exhibit markers of syntactic dependency: subordination, embedding, and nominalization.<br>
2) The WZIĄĆ gram does not exhibit markers of clause coordination.<br>
3) The components (especially the minor verb wziąć) cannot be questioned, answered or replied separately.<br>
4) The WZIĄĆ gram exhibits prosodic properties typical of a single clause rather than a sequence of clauses. The construction constitutes a single phrasal group with no intonation break between its components.<br>
5) The WZIĄĆ gram exhibits a single polarity value.<br>
6) The WZIĄĆ gram has a unitary TAM value and, consequently, the individual components cannot select TAM categories separately.<br>
7) The WZIĄĆ gram is not limited to a few verbal categories of tense, aspect, mood, or voice. <br>
8) Operators of time, space, manner, and instrument extend over the entire construction rather than individual components. The use of such operators for the two verbs separately is ungrammatical.<br>
9) The components of the WZIĄĆ gram invariably and compulsorily share the subject argument. More generally, the WZIĄĆ gram disallows duplicate roles, be they core and peripheral arguments, or adjuncts. The total argument structure is never more complex than the argument structure of V2.<br>
10) Outside the WZIĄĆ gram, the components of this construction are able to occur separately as independent verbs in their own clauses. [@andrason2018a, 618-619]

> The WZIĄĆ gram fully complies with the phonological property of SVCs – namely, a fully audible pause comparable to a break that separates coordinated clauses (both syndetically and asyndetically) is absent in the WZIĄĆ gram (Góralczyk 2010: 100, 103; Gębka-Wolak 2012: 54). For example, in \ref(@polish1), V1 and V2 are pronounced with no pause but rather as a single phonological phrase. In fact, the pause is absent even if some elements intervene between V1 and V2. [@andrason2018a, 587-588]

> The PÓJŚĆ gram is a bi-verbal construction whose components are finite; neither of these verbal components is syntactically dependent on the other; the formative verbs are not connected by a coordinator but rather form a single clause; the PÓJŚĆ gram exhibits a mono-clausal intonation with no pause separating V1 and V2; it also exhibits a single TAM value and a single polarity value; the components of the PÓJŚĆ gram are not marked by incompatible TAM categories; the gram is not restricted to a particular temporal or modal category, but appears in various TAM categories available in Polish; V1 and V2 share their subject argument and duplicate roles are disallowed; lastly, both verbs may occur on their own, thus exhibiting their respective lexical meanings.

The second verb has variously been referred to as operator, auxiliary, reinforcer, vector, and explicator in hte South Asian linguistic literature (we will, henceforth, use the term explicator).

> “A serial verb construction contains two or more verb roots neither that are compounded ...nor members of separate clauses.” (Payne, 2006, p. 288). Serial verbs express various faces of one complex event. According to Payne, the difference of a prototypical serial verb from a coordinate clause construction is that in serial verb construction: 1. There is only one subject. 2. The tense/aspect marking is done only on one verb. 3. The intonation is characteristic of a single clause. (Payne, 2006, p. 289) <br> Chabu [exhibits] serial verbs that fulfill the criteria discussed by Payne. Most of them are formed using a movement verb as first component and the verbs *am* ‘come’ or *no* ‘go’ as a second component of the serial. [@kibebe2015, 327-328]

> ...there is only one subject in each clause. In addition, tense, aspect and number markers are suffixed to only the second verb in the clause. In fact there is a helping auxiliary that precedes the first verb which hosts some person, tense and aspect markers. However, the auxiliary and the markers attached to the auxiliary do not repeat themselves before the second verb. ... most Chabu serial verb constructions place the two verbs that constitute the serial in successive, adjacent position as compounded entities.

> Verb roots can be combined in compound verb stems like *dewo-* 'to come across' in \ref(@suabo1) and in complex phrasal verbs like *mógo-we-wo-re* in \ref(@suabo2). <br>
The verbs *de-* and *wo-* are phonologically and morphologically integratated in the compound verb *dewo-* but in phrasal verbs there is only phonological integration. For example, *mógo-* 'to carry' in \ref(@suabo2) is phonologically one word with the inflected second verb. A sign that these phrasal verb combinations form phonological words is the stress pattern, the bare verb root attracts the main word stress and the second inflected verb receives secondary stress. Another sign is that the /m/ of the subject prefix me- is always realized by its intervocalic allophone [w]. The fact that the subject and object prefixes separale the bare verb form tile following inflected verb signals that there is no morphological integration of the two verbs, in contrast with compound verbs. Complex phrasal verbs frequently occur in the texts ... both with two Inanwatan verbs and with a Malay loan or code mix followed by an inflected form of *ge-* 'to do'. [@devries2004, 57]

> Serial verb constructions are known to be able to include up to seven simple verbs. Serial constructions are strictly contiguous, i.e. no other constituent can intervene between their components. There is just one general restriction: a serial verb construction cannot consist of stative (So) verbs only. <br>
Each component of a serial verb construction is an independent phonological word: it has an independent stress and enclitics can attach to it. All the components of a serial verb require the same subject (cross-referenced on transitive and active intransitive verbs); this means the same inflection for person, number and gender of subject (A/Sa), as in \ref(@tariana1).

> All the components of a serial construction are separate phonological words, since they have independent stress. They have the prosodic properties of a monoverbal clause (cf. Givón 1991). A characteristic property of a prosodic phrase in the Arawak languages of the Upper Rio Negro is the "nasal pause" marker — a phrase final syllable *-hã* — used as a boundary signal (Aikhenvald 1996b). This marker cannot be inserted between the components of serial constructions; it can only appear on the last component. In \ref(@tariana2), *-hã* 'pause marker' appears on the last component of a serial construction marking a boundary between two predicates which belong to adjacent clauses. <br>
... The insertion of the boundary marker between the two components of a serial construction would be ungrammatical (?**haɾia di-swa-hã di-a* (dawn 3SGNF-stay-PAUS 3SGNF-go)). When predicates or clauses are coordinated, there is a characteristic "enumerating" intonation. (The phrase-final syllable is lengthened and the pitch of the phrase final syllable falls.)

> In this section it will be shown that the number of true serial verb constructions is limited indeed. In most cases, constructions that now resemble serial verb constructions are either the result of the loss of inflectional morphology, in particular the loss of the object prefix, or they are grammaticalised verbal elements that still show remnants of an erstwhile status as main predicates. Examples of the former are the expressions of manner and modality, examples of the latter are the verbal conjunctions and prepositions. Constructions with directional verbs, too, display some evidence for serialisation, but they are better characterised as simple clauses with adverbially used verbs (sections 10.14.2 and 10.14.4). Instances of ‘true serialisation’ are the constructions with aspectual verbs maleko ‘on and on’, sari ‘about to’ and jaga ‘often’, but it is noteworthy that two out of three of these verbs are Malay loan words. [@vanstaden2000, 308]

> Paratactic constructions are characterised by a single intonation contour marking as one utterance a unit of more than one independent clause. By independent clause, I mean a finite clause with its own independent truth-values, i.e. it can be negated or modified independent of the other clause(s). The relation between the clauses is not overtly expressed. Iconicity in the relation of events in discourse and the context in which the utterance is placed suggest the relation between the clauses. [@vanstaden2000, 278]

> The distinction between parataxis and serialisation is not always straightforward. In general the ‘tightly-knit’ paratactic constructions will be closest to serialisation. Neither parataxis nor serialisation use conjunctions, and the intonation of both is often like a single clause. In the case of parataxis, however, pauses and a non-final contour on the first clause are always possible, without significantly changing the interpretation, or the interpretation possibilities of the construction...

> Tommo So makes great use of verb chaining, in which two (or more) verbal events are strung together with no overt subordinating morpheme. The events involved often come together to form a coherent whole (i.e. the actions are related), in which case they typically involve at least one consistent argument shared by all verbs in the chain; this argument is not necessarily the subject. In other cases, the verbs involved are not as tightly bound together, and the morphology of verb chaining is simply used to conjoin or subordinate clauses. [@mcpherson2013, 441]

> If the verb is a regular, conjugating verb, a serial construction tends to be used to link the two phrases. There is no separate serial verb form of quasi-verbs. [@mcpherson2013, 217]

> The broad definition of an SVC applied here follows that of Haspelmath (ibid: 2) which states that an SVC is “a monoclausal construction consisting of multiple independent verbs with no element linking them and with no predicate-argument relation254 between the verbs”. <br>
In addition to this overarching feature, SVCs in Tondano also have the following characteristics (these are also considered characteristics of SVCs in Durie 1997:291, Aikhenvald 2006, Dixon 2006, and Noonan 2007:65, 88): <br>
- SVCs are comprised of multiple verbs which occur together within a clause. Other elements (e.g. conjunctions, negators, NPs, or PPs) do not occur between the two verbs. <br> 
- The multiple verbs function as the head of a single predicate, and more importantly, they refer to a situation which is viewed as a single overall event. <br>
- Each verb in the SVC may also function independently as the sole verb in a verbal clause. <br>
- An SVC has only one shared pivot argument. [@brickell2014, 424]

> Example \ref(@tondano2) again displays two separate clauses, despite the absence of a co-ordinating conjunction. The reason this can only be an instance of parataxis is due to a number of features, these are: the pause in intonation between the two verbs, the difference in TAM marking (*<um>* is irrealis while *meN-* is realis), the separate representations of the PIV arguments, and the fact that there are two separate assertions (events) denoted by the verbal predicates.

> Ts’ixa makes use of multiverbal predicates to refer to a particular set of states of affairs which are considered “complex” by the speakers. Verb serialisation has been identified a distinctive feature of the Kx’a and Tuu language families (Güldemann & Vossen 2000), and “lexically complex predicates” (cf. Güldemann 2006, Güldemann & Fehn, forthc.) are known to exist in all known Khoisan languages... I will not follow Kilian-Hatz (2006, 2008, 2013) and Haacke (2014) who refer to them as “serial verb constructions” (SVC). ... I will refer to them as “juncture-verb constructions” (JVC) instead. [@fehn2014, 175-176]

> It may therefore be assumed that synchronically, the juncture is not an active marker in Ts’ixa, and that marking of active voice is not its function in the complex predicates under discussion. Its main function appears to lie in conveying that a verb will be followed by another verbal element – either a full verb or a suffix of verbal origin. All derivative suffixes and two of the three ANTERIOR / PAST suffixes requiring use of the juncture can be shown to have grammaticalised from a verbal source. One may therefore think of the juncture as an element putting verbs into a “construct state” (T. Güldemann, p.c.). Although this function does not coincide with an outright co- or subordination marker, more prototypical SVCs, e.g., those found in Western African languages or in the Kx’a and Tuu families, feature two or more full verbs which do not require any linking element between them.

Serial verbs, combining two verbs, might be considered parts of separate clauses. Nevertheless, they are treated as single complex verbs, because they are unary in meaning, in other words, they express a single event/ predication. They also share a single argument and a single set of inflectional and derivational morphology, thus are considered to be one syntactic unit. [@grunow-harsta2008, 384]

# Discussion

<!-- ```{r setup, include=FALSE} -->
<!-- knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, cache = TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->

The overall tendencies seen in the results of this study align with the hypotheses made in @givon1991 and @himmelmann2022. 
No language description mentioned that serial verb constructions could not be realised in a single intonation unit.^[The data here is obviously influenced by the original assumption made in the literature. I would hazard that information packaging also plays a large role here [cf. @himmelmann2013].] 
As such, we can conclude that all serial verb constructions *can* be realised in a single intonation unit.

My original question, however, was whether *all* serial verb constructions are realised in a single intonation unit. 
The hypothesis made by @himmelmann2022 was that serial verb constructions are IU-bounded constructions, i.e. that they *must* be realised in a single intonation unit as a prosody-dependent construction.
The data suggest that this is not the case in every language.
29 languages out of the 150 languages surveyed (~19.3%) had constructions which meet Himmelmann's definition of a prosodically-robust construction.
A further 4 languages (~2.7%) had prosodically-dependent constructions which are realised over multiple intonation units, i.e. prosodic groupings.
As such, we cannot make the generalisation that all SVCs must be realised within a single intonation unit.

## Areal Patterns

### Prosodically Robust (Grammatical) SVCs

The distribution of grammatical constructions has clear areal tendencies. The majority of languages with this type of construction are found in West Africa or Near Oceania, with a number also found in Central America and other parts of Africa. Notably, the reasons for which a construction was classified as grammatical differ between these areas.

Western African languages such as [Yoruba](\@(#yoruba)) or [Ewe](\@(#ewe)) pass constituency tests typical of grammatical constructions, such as focussing or extraction. 
Notably, two of the languages in Central America with grammatical SVCs are creoles (Saramaccan and Jamaican Creole English) which also allow for separate focussing of verbs through predicate clefting. 
Both of these languages have documented substrates from West Africa with grammatical serial verb constructions  [@kramer2002; @patrick2008].

In Near Oceania, prosodically-robust serial verb constructions typically conformed to a similar constructional template. 
This template consists of concatenated bare verb roots followed by a verb root which takes all relevant marking.
Some descriptions mention the possibility of pauses between roots (e.g. [Kalam](\@(#kalam)) and ), which evidence the prosodically-robust nature of these constructions.

### Prosodically Grouped SVCs

Group Areal patterns
- all in N Oceania
- linked to clause-demarcating use of boundary tones? (cf. Matukar Panau)

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns
- grouping with 'core' level SVCs
    - two IUs condensing into one?
- narrative SVCs/juxtaposition as source construction
- productivity varies between languages
- prosodic word vs. prosodic phrase

- metatypy for gram?

<!--chapter:end:04-citations.Rmd-->

# Implications

Here I'm going to write about what the outcomes of my study are and what this means more broadly for the field.

- not all SVCs need to be realised in single intonation units
    - tendency rather than a rule
    - bc many constructions are discourse-dependent
- different profiles of SVCs in different areas of the world
    - robust constructions in W Africa
    - templatic construction in N Oceania
    - prosodic groupings in N Oceania
    - word-level constructions in Americas
- difference between nuclear and core constructions?
    - grouping only for core

yet unclear
- how pausing/hesitation/repairs interact with word-level phenomena
- how much pausing can be tolerated - gradient?
- role of intonation (contours) in signalling a construction
- to what extent are constructions discourse-dependent
- corpus searches
- psychological reality
- role of areality/contact
