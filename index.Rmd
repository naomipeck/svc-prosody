Serial verb constructions (SVCs) are commonly described as occurring within a single intonation unit (IU) following @givon1991, leading to @himmelmann2022 to assert that they are "IU-bounded constructions". However, as of yet, there is no empirical study exploring the prosodic realisation of SVCs. In this poster, I show results from a first study into the prosody of serial verb constructions, based on a sample of grammatical descriptions from 150 languages with verb serialisation, accompanied with examples from spoken corpora. I find that serial verb constructions do not necessarily need to obey a “One Intonation Unit” constraint.

Initial evidence suggests that we cannot claim that all SVCs are IU-bounded. Himmelmann's claim presupposes that a) serial verb constructions are not grammatically robust, and that b) a serial verb construction will not be recognised as such when realised over multiple IUs. In fact, we find a mix of prosodically-dependent and prosodically-robust types across languages: while the majority of constructions appear to be IU-bounded, a number of constructions can be realised as prosodic groupings (prosodically-dependent constructions consisting of multiple IUs), and elsewhere SVCs can fulfil constituent tests typical of prosodically-robust, i.e. grammaticalised, constructions in other languages.

It has been recognised for a while that the label of serial verb construction is used as an umbrella term for many different constructional subtypes [@foley2010]. My empirical investigation of the prosody of serial verb constructions shows similarly that the “single IU constraint” is not one-size-fits-all.
