> In a main verb + auxiliary construction, the main verb is nonfinite. There are six morphological possibilities. In many instances, the main verb appears as just a verb stem, with no morphology at all. ...
An auxiliary verb always follows the main verb. The auxiliary verb (the final one, if more than one is present in a particular clause) bears finite morphology, or, if the clause is dependent, it is the auxiliary verb which bears whatever nonfinite morphology is used to define the relationship between the clause and another clause, on which it is dependent.[@slater2005, 132]

> In fact, it turns out that constructions of just these two types account for all of the appearances of nonfinite bare verb stems in Mangghuer. It would be possible to treat these two construction types as serializations, and this would certainly be commensurate with previous discussions of serial constructions. However, constructions of the first type can also be accounted for as instances of clause chaining, and we will see in this chapter that they fall naturally into the category of Mangghuer non-final clauses. Constructions of the second type have already been accounted for in Chapter 4, as verb + auxiliary constructions. Thus, although these Mangghuer constructions could be described as instances of serialization, I will describe them with other terms instead. [@slater2005, 231]

> No such postposing of zero-marked non-final clauses is possible. These clauses rely on their position (preceding another clause) to give them a semantic interpretation (preceding the action of the other clause in time). The fact that zero-marked clauses cannot be postposed thus appears to be not a syntactic fact, but rather, simply a semantic fact. If the zero marker had more semantic content, as do some of the other markers we have seen, zero-marked clauses might also be postposable. However, due to the lack of semantic specificity which obtains when no suffix at all is used, linear positioning must bear an unusual semantic load, and postposing becomes impossible.
