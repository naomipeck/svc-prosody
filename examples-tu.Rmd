> A serial verb construction refers to a grammatical structure in which two or more verbs or verb phrases appear together without a marker of coordination or subordination. ... A serial verb construction is common in isolating languages like Thai in which no verbal morphology distinguishes finite and nonfinite verb forms. The degree of integration and relationship between verbs or verb phrases in a series determines the types of serial verb construction. Three major types of serial verb construction in Thai are: the 'subordination' type, the 'coordination' type, and the 'hybrid' type. [@iwasakihorie2005, 231]

> In this section it will be shown that the number of true serial verb constructions is limited indeed. In most cases, constructions that now resemble serial verb constructions are either the result of the loss of inflectional morphology, in particular the loss of the object prefix, or they are grammaticalised verbal elements that still show remnants of an erstwhile status as main predicates. Examples of the former are the expressions of manner and modality, examples of the latter are the verbal conjunctions and prepositions. Constructions with directional verbs, too, display some evidence for serialisation, but they are better characterised as simple clauses with adverbially used verbs (sections 10.14.2 and 10.14.4). Instances of ‘true serialisation’ are the constructions with aspectual verbs maleko ‘on and on’, sari ‘about to’ and jaga ‘often’, but it is noteworthy that two out of three of these verbs are Malay loan words. [@vanstaden2000, 308]

> Paratactic constructions are characterised by a single intonation contour marking as one utterance a unit of more than one independent clause. By independent clause, I mean a finite clause with its own independent truth-values, i.e. it can be negated or modified independent of the other clause(s). The relation between the clauses is not overtly expressed. Iconicity in the relation of events in discourse and the context in which the utterance is placed suggest the relation between the clauses. [@vanstaden2000, 278]

> The distinction between parataxis and serialisation is not always straightforward. In general the ‘tightly-knit’ paratactic constructions will be closest to serialisation. Neither parataxis nor serialisation use conjunctions, and the intonation of both is often like a single clause. In the case of parataxis, however, pauses and a non-final contour on the first clause are always possible, without significantly changing the interpretation, or the interpretation possibilities of the construction...

> Tommo So makes great use of verb chaining, in which two (or more) verbal events are strung together with no overt subordinating morpheme. The events involved often come together to form a coherent whole (i.e. the actions are related), in which case they typically involve at least one consistent argument shared by all verbs in the chain; this argument is not necessarily the subject. In other cases, the verbs involved are not as tightly bound together, and the morphology of verb chaining is simply used to conjoin or subordinate clauses. [@mcpherson2013, 441]

> The broad definition of an SVC applied here follows that of Haspelmath (ibid: 2) which states that an SVC is “a monoclausal construction consisting of multiple independent verbs with no element linking them and with no predicate-argument relation254 between the verbs”. <br>
In addition to this overarching feature, SVCs in Tondano also have the following characteristics (these are also considered characteristics of SVCs in Durie 1997:291, Aikhenvald 2006, Dixon 2006, and Noonan 2007:65, 88): <br>
- SVCs are comprised of multiple verbs which occur together within a clause. Other elements (e.g. conjunctions, negators, NPs, or PPs) do not occur between the two verbs. <br> 
- The multiple verbs function as the head of a single predicate, and more importantly, they refer to a situation which is viewed as a single overall event. <br>
- Each verb in the SVC may also function independently as the sole verb in a verbal clause. <br>
- An SVC has only one shared pivot argument. [@brickell2014, 424]

> Example \ref(@tondano2) again displays two separate clauses, despite the absence of a co-ordinating conjunction. The reason this can only be an instance of parataxis is due to a number of features, these are: the pause in intonation between the two verbs, the difference in TAM marking (*<um>* is irrealis while *meN-* is realis), the separate representations of the PIV arguments, and the fact that there are two separate assertions (events) denoted by the verbal predicates.

> Ts’ixa makes use of multiverbal predicates to refer to a particular set of states of affairs which are considered “complex” by the speakers. Verb serialisation has been identified a distinctive feature of the Kx’a and Tuu language families (Güldemann & Vossen 2000), and “lexically complex predicates” (cf. Güldemann 2006, Güldemann & Fehn, forthc.) are known to exist in all known Khoisan languages... I will not follow Kilian-Hatz (2006, 2008, 2013) and Haacke (2014) who refer to them as “serial verb constructions” (SVC). ... I will refer to them as “juncture-verb constructions” (JVC) instead. [@fehn2014, 175-176]

> It may therefore be assumed that synchronically, the juncture is not an active marker in Ts’ixa, and that marking of active voice is not its function in the complex predicates under discussion. Its main function appears to lie in conveying that a verb will be followed by another verbal element – either a full verb or a suffix of verbal origin. All derivative suffixes and two of the three ANTERIOR / PAST suffixes requiring use of the juncture can be shown to have grammaticalised from a verbal source. One may therefore think of the juncture as an element putting verbs into a “construct state” (T. Güldemann, p.c.). Although this function does not coincide with an outright co- or subordination marker, more prototypical SVCs, e.g., those found in Western African languages or in the Kx’a and Tuu families, feature two or more full verbs which do not require any linking element between them.
