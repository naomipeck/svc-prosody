> The final type of complement clause is an apparent paratactic construction. Again, the first verbs which occur in this type of construction are a restricted set: *gɛnɛ́ye* ‘to go’, *biyɛ́ye* ‘to come’, and *sikɛ́ye* ‘to repeat'. In this construction, two fully inflected verbs appear one after the other without any kind of conjunction or complementizer, just as in two regularly juxtaposed clauses. Semantically, however, they are tightly bound together. [@reader1998, 83-84]

> SVCs in Pnar ... are composed of two verbal elements which occur together in a way that allows both verbs to affect the semantics of the verbal event. The two verbal elements generally occur side by side as a single element... 
In the case of SVCs without a clear head, neither verb root receives affixation, whereas in SVCs with a clear head, the head verb is (or can be) affixed. When the first verb can receive affixation, there seem to be no clear restrictions on what verbs can occur as the second element. When the second verb can receive affixation the first element tends to be a ‘light’ verb or auxiliary. [@ring2015,439]

> The evidence demonstrates that the WZIĄĆ gram can be regarded as a SVC, relatively close to the cross-linguistic prototype postulated by Aikhenvald and Dixon (2006) and Bisang (2009). To be exact, the gram complies with the definitional characteristics of the prototype of a SVC – in each such case, it does so to a high extent: <br>
1) The WZIĄĆ gram does not exhibit markers of syntactic dependency: subordination, embedding, and nominalization.<br>
2) The WZIĄĆ gram does not exhibit markers of clause coordination.<br>
3) The components (especially the minor verb wziąć) cannot be questioned, answered or replied separately.<br>
4) The WZIĄĆ gram exhibits prosodic properties typical of a single clause rather than a sequence of clauses. The construction constitutes a single phrasal group with no intonation break between its components.<br>
5) The WZIĄĆ gram exhibits a single polarity value.<br>
6) The WZIĄĆ gram has a unitary TAM value and, consequently, the individual components cannot select TAM categories separately.<br>
7) The WZIĄĆ gram is not limited to a few verbal categories of tense, aspect, mood, or voice. <br>
8) Operators of time, space, manner, and instrument extend over the entire construction rather than individual components. The use of such operators for the two verbs separately is ungrammatical.<br>
9) The components of the WZIĄĆ gram invariably and compulsorily share the subject argument. More generally, the WZIĄĆ gram disallows duplicate roles, be they core and peripheral arguments, or adjuncts. The total argument structure is never more complex than the argument structure of V2.<br>
10) Outside the WZIĄĆ gram, the components of this construction are able to occur separately as independent verbs in their own clauses. [@andrason2018a, 618-619]

> The WZIĄĆ gram fully complies with the phonological property of SVCs – namely, a fully audible pause comparable to a break that separates coordinated clauses (both syndetically and asyndetically) is absent in the WZIĄĆ gram (Góralczyk 2010: 100, 103; Gębka-Wolak 2012: 54). For example, in \ref(@polish1), V1 and V2 are pronounced with no pause but rather as a single phonological phrase. In fact, the pause is absent even if some elements intervene between V1 and V2. [@andrason2018a, 587-588]

> The PÓJŚĆ gram is a bi-verbal construction whose components are finite; neither of these verbal components is syntactically dependent on the other; the formative verbs are not connected by a coordinator but rather form a single clause; the PÓJŚĆ gram exhibits a mono-clausal intonation with no pause separating V1 and V2; it also exhibits a single TAM value and a single polarity value; the components of the PÓJŚĆ gram are not marked by incompatible TAM categories; the gram is not restricted to a particular temporal or modal category, but appears in various TAM categories available in Polish; V1 and V2 share their subject argument and duplicate roles are disallowed; lastly, both verbs may occur on their own, thus exhibiting their respective lexical meanings.

The second verb has variously been referred to as operator, auxiliary, reinforcer, vector, and explicator in hte South Asian linguistic literature (we will, henceforth, use the term explicator).

> “A serial verb construction contains two or more verb roots neither that are compounded ...nor members of separate clauses.” (Payne, 2006, p. 288). Serial verbs express various faces of one complex event. According to Payne, the difference of a prototypical serial verb from a coordinate clause construction is that in serial verb construction: 1. There is only one subject. 2. The tense/aspect marking is done only on one verb. 3. The intonation is characteristic of a single clause. (Payne, 2006, p. 289) <br> Chabu [exhibits] serial verbs that fulfill the criteria discussed by Payne. Most of them are formed using a movement verb as first component and the verbs *am* ‘come’ or *no* ‘go’ as a second component of the serial. [@kibebe2015, 327-328]

> ...there is only one subject in each clause. In addition, tense, aspect and number markers are suffixed to only the second verb in the clause. In fact there is a helping auxiliary that precedes the first verb which hosts some person, tense and aspect markers. However, the auxiliary and the markers attached to the auxiliary do not repeat themselves before the second verb. ... most Chabu serial verb constructions place the two verbs that constitute the serial in successive, adjacent position as compounded entities.

> [V]erb-verb sequences, by which I mean sequences of verb stems, of which the first stem does not carry switch reference marking ... have characteristics of serial verb constructions (Aikhenvald 2006): they act together as a single predicate without any overt marker of coordination, subordination or other dependency relation, they share TAM values and arguments, they present things as a single state of affairs, and furthermore, the verbs which are components of the sequence can stand on their own. The transitivity values of the verbs may be different. The subject clitic occurs maximally once (reflecting the status of the event as a single unit described in one clause).

This is the highest form of continuity possible between two events. The second two are linked only by a slight pause and drop in intonation, indicated by the period.

> SET has a limited number of complex verb phrases that function as a complementation strategy. They have no overt subordination or coordination markers. These constructions exhibit the following properties of serial verb constructions: i) they share the same subject and markers of tense and aspect; ii) they contain two verbs without overt markers of coordination or subordination; iii) the verbs form a single predicate; iv) serialized verbs also occur alone in non-serial constructions; v) the negation particle *cham* has scope over the two verbs; vi) the adverb has scope over the two verbs; vii) there is no lexical or grammatical material between the verbs, with the exception of the cause-effect type; and viii) these predicates are not marked by the suffix -ji, which is a productive marker expressing dependency. [@garciasalido2014, 141]

> Juxtaposition is often preferred in natural conjunction--that is, when the two conjuncts usually go together and form some kind of conceptual unit. In SET the lack of an overt coordinator may allow the encoding of a construction that is called a serial verb, where the two verbs in a sequence express one single event, as illustrated in (@tepehuan2) with the verbs ‘work’ and ‘plant.’ The two verbs in this construction do not show any kind of dependency.

> Verb roots can be combined in compound verb stems like *dewo-* 'to come across' in \ref(@suabo1) and in complex phrasal verbs like *mógo-we-wo-re* in \ref(@suabo2). <br>
The verbs *de-* and *wo-* are phonologically and morphologically integratated in the compound verb *dewo-* but in phrasal verbs there is only phonological integration. For example, *mógo-* 'to carry' in \ref(@suabo2) is phonologically one word with the inflected second verb. A sign that these phrasal verb combinations form phonological words is the stress pattern, the bare verb root attracts the main word stress and the second inflected verb receives secondary stress. Another sign is that the /m/ of the subject prefix me- is always realized by its intervocalic allophone [w]. The fact that the subject and object prefixes separale the bare verb form tile following inflected verb signals that there is no morphological integration of the two verbs, in contrast with compound verbs. Complex phrasal verbs frequently occur in the texts ... both with two Inanwatan verbs and with a Malay loan or code mix followed by an inflected form of *ge-* 'to do'. [@devries2004, 57]
