# Background

Here I'm going to write something about why I'm doing this study.

Firstly, serial verb constructions are commonly assumed to encode a single event, due to their similar distribution to single verbs [e.g. @aikhenvald2006; @bisang2009].
@pawley1985 suggested that serial verb constructions actually can encode more than one event.
@givon1991 tested this hypothesis by using the proxy of breath groups for events, and found that the large majority of SVCs were realised within a single breath group. This finding was then taken more broadly to mean that all SVCs were realised in either a single intonation unit, or under a single intonation contour.
However, @chafe1996 hypothesised that no more than "one new idea" can be realised in a given intonation unit at a time, which would suggest that serial verb constructions - which realise 'one event' - should be realised within a single intonation unit. It additionally suggests, however, that discourse plays a role in how events are construed.

The constraint as it is tested in this work takes the form of @himmelmann2022's assertion that SVCs are "IU-bounded constructions", i.e. the construction is only recogniseable as an SVC when it is realised within the same intonation unit.

This will relate to this part of the abstract:
Serial verb constructions (SVCs) are commonly described as occurring within a single intonation unit (IU) following Givón 1991, leading to Himmelmann (2022) to assert that they are “IU-bounded constructions”. However, as of yet, there is no empirical study exploring the prosodic realisation of SVCs.
