  abstract = {Idioms are strings of words whose figurative meaning does not necessarily derive from that of the constituent parts. They belong to the vast and heterogeneous realm of multiword expressions, i.e. literal and non-literal word clusters whose representations are stored in semantic memory. This article provides an updated review of the psycholinguistic and electrophysiological literature on the processes underlying idiom comprehension with specific reference to the cues that lead to idiom recognition, to the syntactic and semantic behavior of idioms, to the relationships between literal compositionality and idiomatic meaning retrieval. Behavioral models of idiom comprehension are presented and discussed also with respect to the electrophysiological correlates of idiom and figurative language comprehension.},

In formulating an alternative view, we consider both prototype and exemplar-learning models of categorization. We argue for a `hybrid' usage-based view in which acquisition depends on exemplar learning and retention, out of which permanent abstract schemas gradually emerge and are immanent across the summed similarity of exemplar collections. These schemas are graded in strength depending on the number of exemplars and the degree to which semantic similarity is reinforced by phonological, lexical, and distributional similarity.},

Gestures can be distinguished from other movements, segmented, and assigned meaning based on their forms and functions. Moreover, gestures systematically integrate with language at all levels of linguistic structure, as evidenced in both production and perception. Viewed typologically, gesture is universal, but nevertheless exhibits constrained variation across language communities (as does language itself ). Finally, gesture has rich cognitive dimensions in addition to its communicative dimensions. In overviewing these and other topics, we show that the study of language is incomplete without the study of its communicative partner, gesture.},

Since that time, hundreds of studies have used this method. Here, we review the original definition of VOT, propose some extensions to the definition, and discuss some problematic cases. We propose a set of terms for the most important aspects of VOT and a set of Praat labels that could provide some consistency for future cross-study analyses. Although additions of other aspects of realization of voicing distinctions (F0, amplitude, duration of voicelessness) could be considered, they are rejected as adding too much complexity for what has turned out to be one of the most frequently used metrics in phonetics and phonology.},

We analysed electrical activity of ghost fungi (               Omphalotus nidiformis               ), Enoki fungi (               Flammulina velutipes               ), split gill fungi (               Schizophyllum commune               ) and caterpillar fungi (               Cordyceps militaris               ). The spiking characteristics are species specific: a spike duration varies from 1 to 21 h and an amplitude from 0.03 to 2.1 mV. We found that spikes are often clustered into trains. Assuming that spikes of electrical activity are used by fungi to communicate and process information in mycelium networks, we group spikes into words and provide a linguistic and information complexity analysis of the fungal spiking activity. We demonstrate that distributions of fungal word lengths match that of human languages. We also construct algorithmic and Liz-Zempel complexity hierarchies of fungal sentences and show that species               S. commune               generate the most complex sentences.},

An unexpected outcome of this comparison is that Proto-Siraya still had distinct reflexes of ProtoAustronesian *R and *S, although they subsequently merged in a palatal fricative in the individual dialects of Siraya.},

The specification of cognitive system capacities is often shaped by unexamined intuitive assumptions about the search space and complexity of a subcomputation. However, a mistaken intuition might make such initial conceptualizations misleading for what empirical questions appear relevant later on. We undertake here computational-level modeling and complexity analyses of segmentation \textemdash{} a widely hypothesized subcomputation that plays a requisite role in explanations of capacities across domains \textemdash{} as a case study to show how crucial it is to formally assess these assumptions. We mathematically prove two sets of results regarding hardness and search space size that may run counter to intuition, and position their implications with respect to existing views on the subcapacity.},

Prior to Bickerton's seminal paper in 1989, it was widely assumed that Serial Verb Constructions were not part of KS grammar. More recent studies (Adone 2012; Syea 2013a, 2013b; Gabel 2018) have shown that these constructions do exist in Indian Ocean Creoles and in KS. Likewise, in this paper, we will demonstrate that from a typological perspective, prototypical as well as non-prototypical SVCs can be found in KS. In our analysis, we provide evidence that an ethnosyntactic framework can account for certain SVCs in KS. We argue that their form and function can be accounted for by cultural logic hence stressing the link between grammar and culture.},

  abstract = {There has been a long debate on whether demonstratives are directly referential as Kaplan originally argued, or indirectly referential like a definite description. I propose a new analysis of demonstratives that combines intuitions from both direct and indirect approaches. The demonstrative is analyzed as an indirectly referential expression with a binary maximality operator that takes two arguments, where the second argument can be a deictic pointing, an anaphoric index, or a relative clause. Direct reference is encoded not in the meaning of the demonstrative but in the meaning contributed by the pointing gesture, thus capturing both direct and indirect uses. I further propose that some pronouns in English function as demonstratives, realizing the binary structure and competing with the demonstrative. The main advantages of this proposal include (a) deriving the distribution of pronominal and adnominal demonstratives systematically; (b) capturing the unique interaction that demonstratives have with a pointing gesture; and (c) locating English demonstratives against a larger, cross-linguistic picture.},

In particular, we focus on a new paradigm of hearsay evidential markers \textemdash{} more specifically, the V-ta ha-X\,{$>$}\,V-ta-X type, among them -tako, -tamye, -tamyense, -tanun, and -tanta (see Ahn \& Yap 2014) \textemdash{} and using data from the Sejong Contemporary Spoken Corpus, we examine the extended uses of these hearsay evidential markers in natural conversations, and show how these `say'-derived evidential markers contribute to the expression of different shades of speaker stance. Special attention is also given to their distinctive roles in modulating the strength \textemdash{} as well as pragmatic nuance \textemdash{} of an epistemic claim. This study also examines the role of main-clause ellipsis, in particular its contribution to the reanalysis of the (quoted) complement clause as a stand-alone `new main clause', and the concomitant reinterpretation of the erstwhile ha `say' complement-taking matrix clause as a sentence final particle that often retains an evidential reading but also captures the pragmatic nuance of its discourse context. The findings of this study contribute to a fuller understanding of how `say'-derived evidential constructions in Korean (and potentially also in other languages) extend their semantic scope to develop into markers of speakers' subjective and intersubjective/interpersonal stance.},

Serial verbs in Tariana provide important evidence in favour of the existence of cross-linguistically valid defining properties of serial verbs. Verb serialisation and verb compounding are independent grammatical processes, each with a grammaticalisation path of its own, and with distinct functions. Their coexistence in one language is consistent with the principle of iconic motivation: the closer the elements are in surface structure, the more they are grammaticalised or lexicalised.},

The trichotomy of `body' (s{$\Elzschwa$}p), `mind' (mawul) and `spirit' (kayik) in Manambu reflects a culturally embedded conceptualization of what a human is. Each of the three taxonomic units has specific grammatical properties. The physical and mental profile of a human being in Manambu (as in many other languages) cannot be appreciated without understanding the grammar. Conversely, a structural analysis of a language is incomplete unless it makes reference to the system of belief and concepts encoded in it.},

  abstract = {Serial verb constructions, or serial verbs, are sequences of verbs without any overt marker of coordination, subordination, or syntactic dependency of any sort. Serial verbs are monoclausal constructions describing what is conceptualized as a single event. They share prosodic properties with monoverbal constructions. A serial verb has one tense, aspect, mood, modality, and evidentiality value, that is, for example, one component cannot refer to past and another to present. Its components cannot be negated or questioned separately from the whole construction. Each component must be able to occur on its own, as the main verb of a clause. Prototypical serial verb constructions tend to share the subject and other core arguments. Serial verbs are a powerful means for a detailed portrayal of various facets of one single event. They often express grammatical meanings, including aspect and directionality, especially in languages where little inflection is available. A serial verb cannot be felicitously rephrased with a sequence of clauses. In terms of their composition, serial verbs divide into symmetrical and asymmetrical types. Symmetrical serial verb constructions consist of two or more verbs chosen from semantically and grammatically unrestricted verb classes. Their semantics covers sequences of sub-actions or concomitant actions related to each other; the order of components tends to be iconic. Symmetrical serial verbs tend to become lexicalized. Asymmetrical constructions include a ``major'' verb from an unrestricted class and a ``minor'' verb from a restricted verb class. They may express various grammatical categories, such as direction, orientation, aspect, change of state, adding an argument, and increasing valency. The order of components does not have to be iconic. The minor component tends to grammaticalize into an exponent of aspect or modality, directionality, etc. Then the erstwhile serial verb will lose its status as such. Grammatical categories of person-number, aspect, tense, modality, evidentiality, etc., may be marked just once per serial construction (single marking). Alternatively, they can be marked on each component (concordant marking). Further parameters for the classification of serial verbs include contiguity of components and wordhood of the construction. The components of some types of serial verbs may have to be strictly contiguous. Alternatively, other constituents may intervene between them. Some serial verbs may form one grammatical word, others will consist of several grammatical words. Verb compounding differs from single-word serialization: verbal compounds are nonproductive one-word verb-verb combinations whose meaning is only partly predictable, while serial verbs are a productive device with an array of meanings, as in Alamblak (see Bruce 1988 [cited under Serial Verbs and Event Representation]), Yimas: (see Foley 1991 [cited under Papuan Languages of New Guinea]), and Olutec (see Zavala 2006 [cited under Languages of North America, Including Meso-America]). Languages with multi-word serial verbs tend to be of analytic profile.},

  abstract = {Over the last few decades, there has been a tremendous increase in the production of descriptive grammars for languages that had previously been poorly described or lacked description altogether. In most cases, these are minority languages, and many of them are endangered. To enhance the dialogue between grammar-writers and typologists, the conference Descriptive Grammars and Typology was held at the University of Helsinki (Finland) at the end of March, 2019. In this paper, we discuss three current trends in grammar writing that emerged from the conference plenaries as well as from many other presentations: (i) the target audience of grammars and the role of language communities in grammar writing, (ii) the digitalization of grammaticography and (iii) themes that have earlier been more or less neglected in grammars but that would bring more insight into typological research as well as into understanding the structures of individual languages: discourse, variation, diachrony and contact effect of languages.},

This effect has been explained as a search for focus, furthering rapid apprehension of semantic structure. A first experiment supported this explanation: English listeners detected phoneme targets in sentences more rapidly when the target-bearing words were in accented position or in focussed position, but the two effects interacted, consistent with the claim that the effects serve a common cause. In a second experiment a similar asymmetry was observed with Dutch listeners and Dutch sentences. In a third and a fourth experiment, proficient Dutch users of English heard English sentences; here, however, the two effects did not interact. The results suggest that less efficient mapping of prosody to semantics may be one way in which nonnative listening fails to equal native listening.},

By comparing English to German and Romanian, we show that this restriction may have two sources: the event complexity of the nominalization or the lexical semantics of the preposition that introduces the external argument. First, the realization of non-agentive causers requires the presence of a result state component that is absent in German nominal infinitives and English ing-of gerunds. This leads to the inability of these nominalizations to host non-agentive external arguments. Second, the prepositions that introduce external arguments have a restricted distribution in Romanian and English nominalizations with the effect that the restriction appears in all Romanian nominalizations and in English derived nominals. The corresponding preposition in German is unrestricted, which explains why -ung nominals, which project a result state component, can realize non-agentive external arguments.},

Finally, (E) Aristotle was only interested in form as a corollary of function. (A\textendash E) have given rise to different developments in linguistics. (A) is a premise for all linguists, but has been developed, perhaps to its limits, in post-Fregean semantics. Since the last quarter of the 20th century, (B) has been pursued by cognitive linguists. (C) was taken up by the speculative grammarians of the late middle ages. The rationalists of the 17th and 18th centuries took up (D), revising the interpretation of their speculative precursors to seek universal grammar in the rational minds of the human beings perceiving the world around them. Chomsky reinterprets the rationalist doctrine to seek universal grammar in the human mind while eschewing the relevance of human perception of anything other than linguistic input. Functional linguistics has picked up on (E). So, today\~Os formal linguists, cognitivists, functionalists, and Chomskyites may often be at odds with each other, but all tread in Aristotle\~Os footprints.},

Rather than accepting conventionality as a criterion for `deadness', they argued that only metaphors which `play no particularly interesting role in our conceptual system, and hence are not metaphors we live by... deserve to be called ``dead''' (1980: 55). In later work, Lakoff revisited this definition, suggesting that `dead' was most accurately reserved for cases such as pedigree, a `one-shot' metaphor that is not transparent for English speakers because no `literal' sense exists. This paper examines a number of `dead' or `historical' linguistic metaphors for which no `literal' sense exists in present day English, and considers how and why these `died'. Some, like pedigree, do not appear to reflect any system-wide mapping, and it is perhaps unsurprising that their metaphoric nature has become opaque. Others, like ardent and comprehend, demonstrate conceptual mappings that must have been active when their metaphorical senses first emerged, and which are still live in other lexemes. To date, there has been little interrogation of the reasons for the loss of literal senses of metaphorically motivated lexemes. I hope to demonstrate that an examination of the historical evidence for the different stages in the `life' of particular linguistic metaphors can shed light on the nature of metaphor death.},

The main objective of the research presented in this paper is to explore the influential factors on student engagement in HEIs in the situational frame where student engagement and active learning and teaching do not have a long tradition. To answer our research questions, we conducted a survey with 279 undergraduate students from four universities in Libya. Our findings show that the availability and active usage of the university's ICTs resources, the university's reputation and teachers' activating influence on students most efficiently predict student engagement in HEIs. The role of teachers and their competencies to use active learning techniques are perceived to be very influential in promoting student engagement.},

The majority of the contributors to the corpus are mother tongue speakers of English, but, in order to be included in the corpus, each assignment had to be judged proficient by assessors in the contributor's discipline, regardless of the writer's mother tongue. The corpus contains, therefore, only texts that have met departmental requirements for the given level of study.             University writing programmes are typically aimed at undergraduate and Master's students, and it would be useful for writing tutors to know more about student assignment genres and the linguistic features of successful writing at undergraduate and Master's level. However, most large-scale descriptive studies of academic writing focus on published or publicly accessible texts, or learner essays on general academic topics, probably because there are practical difficulties associated with collecting large amounts of well-documented student output. This paper charts the experience of collecting data for the BAWE corpus, highlighting the problems we encountered and the solutions we chose, with a view to facilitating the task of future developers of academic student writing corpora.},

Using Ewe (Gbe), Likpe (Na-Togo) and Akan (Tano) as exemplars, I demonstrate that these languages have trivalent predicates and various constructions in which a single verb hosts three arguments in a clause. The languages deploy three-place predicate, adpositional, SVC, and adnominal strategies to code three-participant situations. I argue that there are semantic differences between the various constructions. The hyper-transitivity of these languages might account for the presence of three-place predicate constructions.},

An attempt is made to explain the usage of grammatical forms from different perspectives. Priority is given to semantic, functional and discourse-pragmatic concerns although formal constraints and diachronic considerations are also invoked in the explanations. A major concern throughout the thesis is to characterise the communicative competence of a native speaker of Ewe.},

In the former Path is encoded in verbs and in the latter it is encoded in non-verb elements that function as sisters to co-event expressing verbs such as manner verbs. Verb serializing languages pose a challenge to this typology as they express Path as well as the Co-event of manner in finite verbs that together function as a single predicate in translational motion clause. We argue that these languages do not fit in the typology and constitute a type of their own. We draw on data from Akan and Frog story narrations in Ewe, a Kwa language, and Sranan, a Caribbean Creole with Gbe substrate, to show that in terms of discourse properties verb serializing languages behave like Verb-framed with respect to some properties and like Satellite-framed languages in terms of others. This study fed into the revision of the typology and such languages are now said to be equipollently-framed languages.},

We see this practice as contrary to calls for cognitive justice and as hampering progress toward the development of inclusive and truly universally valid theories of pragmatics. We illustrate these points by discussing four themes which have been tested in non-Western languages: speech acts, conversational implicatures, (im)politeness, and Conversation Analysis. We then move on to the domain of research ethics and find that, here too, practices tend to reflect Western values, prioritizing Western notions of ethics and what is important to people and ultimately falling short of serving the needs both of the communities where the data are collected, and of the researchers themselves. We conclude with recommending three steps we can all take to make pragmatics a more inclusive discipline, respecting and reflecting patterns of language-in-use irrespective of where they are located geographically.},

However, a search for published or unpublished linguistic research in Haji reveals little more than a name on a dialect list or a mark on a map. This paper is a simple description of the Haji speech variety, intended to address a hole in our collective knowledge base. Haji is interesting because of its heavy borrowings, the pattern of borrowings, and the presence of Malay phonological and lexical archaisms, all of which are briefly presented in the paper. The first part of the paper presents a report of the survey activities conducted in this language group, and the the rest of the paper is a series of arguments which attempt to demonstrate that Haji, in spite of intense influence from neighboring Lampungic dialects, is genetically of Malay stock.},

In many languages deverbal nouns tend to develop into what Vendler (1967) called perfect nouns. Various stages of this development in Norwegian are proposed, drawing on Grammaticalization Theory and Lexicalization Theory. Frequency data are provided from a large newspaper corpus. The deverbal nouns are analyzed as going through a process of lexicalization where reduction in compositionality, reduced token frequency and increased idiosyncrasy are central elements. This process is triggered by relevance to the root, language use, isomorphism and the maximal difference principle. The article shows that Norwegian deverbal nouns are in a state of flux and that even different members of the same morphological type may behave quite differently syntactically and semantically.},

How AVCs differ from other common sub-types of complex predicate such as serial verb constructions or light verb constructions is exemplified, and more minor or tradition-specific terms are also discussed in brief. The varied sources for the development of AVCs are cursorily introduced and how such constructions further develop into complex verb forms once grammaticalized is briefly discussed.

Accordingly, the study corroborates the view that SVCs may derive from asyndetic coordination and, by accumulating properties associated with different parts of the clausality/verbiness continuum, gradually develop towards SVC. This gradualness is not only diachronic, but may also be observed synchronically.},

  abstract = {Although 'glue semantics' is the most extensively developed theory of semantic composition for LFG, it is not very well integrated into the LFG projection architecture, due to the absence of a simple and well-explained correspondence between glue-proofs and f-structures. In this paper I will show that we can improve this situation with two steps: (1) Replace the current quantificational formulations of glue (either Girard's system F, or first order linear logic) with strictly propositional linear logic (the quantifier, unit and exponential free version of either MILL or ILL, depending on whether or not tensors are used). (2) Reverse the direction of the standard cr-projection from f-structure to meaning, giving one going from the (atomic nodes of) the glue-proof to the f-structure, rather than from the f-structure to a 'semantic projection' which is itself somehow related to the glue-proof. As a side effect, the standard semantic projection of LFG glue semantics can be dispensed with. A result is that LFG sentence structures acquire a level composed of strictly binary trees, constructed out of nodes representing function application and lambda abstraction, with a significant resemblance to external and internal merge in the Minimalist Program. This increased resemblance between frameworks might assist in making useful comparisons.},

It is generally regarded as a construction in which two or more verbs share the same arguments within a single clause. The verbs in the series must share some grammatical properties such as tense, aspect and polarity. However, there is a verb sequence construction in D\`ag\'a\'ar\`e that shows apparent similarities to SVCs but with different values for aspect on the verbs. This paper investigates the internal structure of D\`ag\'a\'ar\`e SVCs and other verb sequence constructions such as multi-aspectual constructions (MACs) and coordinate structures. Applying a variety of syntactic and semantic tests, the paper distinguishes SVCs from MACs and coordination and shows the relation between MACs and coordination. Based on the results of the tests, I argue that although MACs have some properties of SVCs, they are not SVCs. Rather; I conclude that MACs pattern with coordination or covert coordination in D\`ag\'a\'ar\`e and they are perceived to express distinct events.},

Four-year-old and 5-year-old children's perception and production of quantity contrasts were examined using a pair of names that contrast in the quantity of the medial nasal. Frequencies of the quantity contrast were also calculated using stories in Guina-ang Bontok. The results indicated that even though the overall frequency of geminate consonants was very low in Guina-ang Bontok, children clearly differentiated the single and geminate nasals in both perception and production. Guina-ang Bontok children's perception and production data resembled those of Finnish children although the frequency of the geminates was much lower in Guina-ang Bontok than in Finnish. Possible explanations for this are provided.},

  abstract = {Coordinating compounds, i.e. complex word forms in which the constituent lexemes are in a coordination relation, may be divided into two classes: hyperonymic, in which the referent of the whole compound is the ``sum'' of the meanings of the constituent lexemes (Korowai yumdef\'ol `(her) husband-wife, couple'; van Enk, Gerrit J., \& Lourens de Vries. 1997. The Korowai of Irian Jaya: Their language in its cultural context. Oxford: Oxford University Press: 66), and hyponymic, where the compound designates a single referent having features of all the constituents (English actor-director). It has been proposed that languages choose either type as the one with the ``tightest'' marking pattern; whereas the crosslinguistic tendency is to have tighter hyperonymic compounds, most languages of Europe rather have tighter hyponymic compounds (Arcodia, Giorgio Francesco, Nicola Grandi, \& Bernhard W\"alchli 2010. Coordination in compounding. In Sergio Scalise \& Irene Vogel (eds.), Cross-disciplinary issues in compounding, 177\textendash 198. Amsterdam \& Philadelphia: John Benjamins). In this paper, we will test this assumption on noun-noun compounds in a sample of 20 Standard Average European languages and in a balanced sample of 60 non-SAE languages, arguing that the preference for hyperonymic compounds is best explained by the default referential function of nouns; in hyponymic compounds, on the other hand, nouns are used to indicate properties. We will then compare nominal and adjectival coordinating compounds, showing that for the latter the hyponymic compounding pattern is the dominant one, as adjectives are prototypical property-denoting words.},

This paper aims to analyse the correlations between form and function in reduplicating constructions in a sample of twenty Sinitic languages, representing eight branches of the family, comparing them to a set of fourteen non-Sinitic languages of the East- and Southeast Asian area. We will show that the various semantic nuances conveyed by reduplicated verbs could be argued to derive from the core meaning of verbal reduplication as iteration of an event, either over a bounded or an unbounded timespan. On the structural level, a pervasive feature of reduplication lies in its compliance to strict requirements on the morphological makeup of the base. This holds especially in the case of the reduplication of disyllabic and bimorphemic verbs with increasing semantics, a consistent pattern across our sample.},

Since datives tend to be pronominal, adding them onto existing argument structures avoids a clash with the Preferred Argument Structure (PAS) Quantity constraint against more than one lexical noun phrase per clause. Supporting a more fluid adjunct/argument distinction, our first claim is that different Hebrew datives are grammaticized as arguments to different degrees. We then demonstrate a correlation between the degree of grammaticization of the dative as an argument and pronoun/lexical ratios. We show that incipient grammaticization phases involve virtually exclusive use of pronominal datives, but deeper grammaticization phases allow increased use of lexical nouns, within the constraints of PAS. Thus, it is pronouns that blaze the path from adjunct to argument status.},

It is shown that in most languages the distribution of different ergative markers splits along the lines predicted by the referential hierarchy (local pronouns {$>$} non-local pronouns {$>$} proper names {$>$} kinship terms {$>$} humans {$>$} nonhumans {$>$} inanimates), thus complementing the much better known ergativity splits. Other types of conditioning of ``multiple ergatives'' include gender, such nominal morphosyntactic features as number and (in)definiteness, as well as clausal morphosyntactic features like tense/aspect, polarity and person of co-arguments. ``Fluid'' systems where the choice of ergative marker is based on semantic or pragmatic factors are attested as well. The article also discusses the implications of ergative allomorphy and ergative alternations for the typology of ergativity and case marking in general.},

In Roger Blench \& Matthew Spriggs (eds.), Archaeology and language IV: Language change and cultural transformation, 138\textendash 148. London \& New York: Routledge). Despite their many virtues, these studies are limited by the size of their data samples, their dependence on qualitative data without quantitative analysis, and their use of hand-drawn maps. This paper presents the results of an entirely new survey of retroflexion in South Asia \textendash one that incorporates a larger language sample, quantitative analysis, and computer-generated maps. The study focuses on the genetic and geographic distribution of various retroflex subsystems, including retroflex obstruents, nasals, liquids, approximants and vowels. While it is possible to establish broad statistical correlations between specific types of contrast and individual language families (or sub-families), the study finds that the distribution of most retroflex systems is more geographic in nature than genetic. Thus, while retroflexion is characteristic of South Asia as a whole, each type of retroflex system tends to cut across genetic lines, marking out its own space within the broader linguistic area.},

It is thus proposed that research on rhythm be based on the same principles for all languages, something that does not apply to the widely accepted division of languages into stress- and syllable-timed. The hypothesis is advanced that these universal principles are grouping and prominence and evidence to support it is provided.},

Eight participants per language produced speech using three elicitation methods, spontaneous speech, story reading and reading a set of sentences divided into ``uncontrolled'' sentences from original works of each language, and sentences devised to maximize or minimize syllable structure complexity (``stress-timed'' and ``syllable-timed'' sets respectively). Rhythm classifications based on pooled data were inconsistent across metrics, while cross-linguistic differences in scores were often statistically non-significant even for comparisons between prototypical languages like English and Spanish. Metrics showed substantial inter-speaker variation and proved very sensitive to elicitation method and syllable complexity, so that the size of both effects was large and often comparable to that of language. These results suggest that any cross-linguistic differences captured by metrics are not robust; metric scores range substantially within a language and are readily affected by a variety of methodological decisions, making crosslinguistic comparisons and rhythmic classifications based on metrics unsafe at best.},

Using acoustic data, we show (i) that the exact contour shape depends on the length of the question, and (ii) that the position of the first peak and the low plateau depends on the position of the stressed syllables, and shows predictable adjustments in alignment, depending on the proximity of adjacent tonal targets. Models that specify the F0 of all syllables, or models that specify F0 by superposing contour shapes for shorter and longer domains, cannot account for such fine-grained lawful variation except by using ad hoc tonal specifications, which, in turn, do not allow for phonological generalisations about contours applying to utterances of greatly different lengths. In contrast, our findings follow easily from an autosegmental-metrical approach to intonational phonology, according to which melodies may contain long F0 stretches derived by interpolation between specified targets associated with metrically strong syllables and prosodic boundaries.},

  abstract = {Construction Grammar holds that unpredictable form-meaning combinations are not restricted in size. In particular, there may be phrases that have particular meanings that are not predictable from the words that they contain, but which are nonetheless not purely idiosyncratic. In addressing this observation, some construction grammarians have not only weakened the word/phrase distinction, but also denied the lexicon/grammar distinction. In this paper, we consider the word/phrase and lexicon/grammar distinction in light of Lexical-Functional Grammar and its Lexical Integrity Principle. We show that it is not necessary to remove the word/phrase distinction or the lexicon/grammar distinction to capture constructional effects, although we agree that there are important generalizations involving constructions of all sizes that must be captured at both syntactic and semantic levels. We use LFG's templates, bundles of grammatical descriptions, to factor out grammatical information in such a way that it can be invoked either by words or by construction-specific phrase structure rules. Phrase structure rules that invoke specific templates are thus the equivalent of phrasal constructions in our approach, but Lexical Integrity and the separation of word and phrase are preserved. Constructional effects are captured by systematically allowing words and phrases to contribute comparable information to LFG's level of functional structure; this is just a generalization of LFG's usual assumption that ``morphology competes with syntax'' (Bresnan, 2001).},

While it is philosophically problematic to prove the non-existence of a phenomenon, we examine data from a large-scale production study for both direct and indirect evidence of stress, contributing to the growing body of literature in this field. In the first case, evidence is sought that indicates that a particular syllable in a word exhibits acoustic properties typically associated with prominence (i.e. fundamental frequency (f0), duration, intensity, vowel quality). In the second case, evidence of enhancement of these properties on a particular syllable under focus is sought, for a more abstract stress property that is not overtly manifested at the word level. Although we find no evidence of lexical prominence, we observe acoustic patterns consistent with a higher level prominence corresponding to focus, manifested by strong (Intonational Phrase) boundary properties. Overall, our findings reveal that there is strong support for a class of languages lacking lexical stress, and in the absence of a stressed syllable to enhance, focus may be manifested prosodically as boundary properties.},

  abstract = {The study of language has been historically proposed as a model for human sciences. For the structuralists, it is because languages, like society, and cultural habits, are man-made rule-based systems. For the Darwinists, it is because cultures and societies are like living species, and can be studied with biological methodology. Sociology, biology and linguistics are considered analogous in different ways. To support work in theoretical and applied linguistics, this paper discusses the problem of the nature of language, investigating how the question ``What is language?'' has been approached from different angles. Textbook answers guide us in many different directions: language is a tool for communication\textemdash and for thinking. It is a collection of words and instructions how to use them. It is the characteristic which\textemdash arguably\textemdash separates humans from other animals. It is a social construction, a system of symbols, a system of systems, and so on. To classify perspectives, the intellectual history of schools of linguistic thought is examined, connecting linguistic theory with related disciplines. A taxonomy is proposed based on two axes: humanistic versus biological; and historical versus systemic. Main linguistics frameworks are identified and placed into a fourfold table based on these axes. They include the Bloomfieldian school (Type 1); Saussurean structuralism and its derivatives (Type 2); generative grammar and biolinguistics (Type 3); and cognitive-evolutionary linguistics (Type 4).},

It presents a preliminary model for Malagasy simple declaratives, focusing on the role that pitch accents play in demarcating Intermediate Phrase boundaries. Six native speakers of Malagasy from the Central Highlands of Madagascar produced declaratives that varied in their syntax, specifically in ways that affected the length of the predicate and the subject. The results indicate that there are two prosodic levels in Malagasy declaratives that are marked with intonation: the intonational phrase, marked at its right edge with a boundary tone (L\%), and the intermediate phrase (ip), which corresponds to a major syntactic constituent such as the predicate or the subject noun phrase. The rightmost stressed syllable of each predicate ip, regardless of its length, bears a rising pitch accent, and the subject bears a similar rising tone, but without prominence, indicating that some Malagasy prosodic constituents mark boundaries with pitch accents. The results of this study will contribute to a full model of Malagasy intonation in the AM framework.},

Previous work on Bardi prosody identified several functions of boundary tones and two main phrase types, but stressed that findings were preliminary. Here we extend that work and show evidence for several additional phrase types, as well as confirming the overall accuracy of automated clustering. This work adds to the prosodic typology of Australian languages (cf. Fletcher et al. 2002) and provides further evidence for the functions of intonation beyond demarcation in these languages. When coupled with evaluation by a knowledgeable researcher, this automated approach can greatly expedite prosodic analysis on a large scale and expand our typology of prosodic systems.},

How much text would we need to sample the full phoneme inventory of a language? In the phonetic/phonemic domain, what proportion of the phoneme inventory can we expect to sample in a text of a given length? Answering these questions in a quantifiable way is tricky, but asking them is necessary. The cumulative collection of Illustrative Texts published in the Illustration series in this journal over more than four decades (mostly renditions of the `North Wind and the Sun') gives us an ideal dataset for pursuing these questions. Here we investigate a tractable subset of the above questions, namely: What proportion of a language's phoneme inventory do these texts enable us to recover, in the minimal sense of having at least one allophone of each phoneme? We find that, even with this low bar, only three languages (Modern Greek, Shipibo and the Treger dialect of Breton) attest all phonemes in these texts. Unsurprisingly, these languages sit at the low end of phoneme inventory sizes (respectively 23, 24 and 36 phonemes). We then estimate the rate at which phonemes are sampled in the Illustrative Texts and extrapolate to see how much text it might take to display a language's full inventory. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for linguistics in its quest to represent the world's phonetic diversity, and for               JIPA               in its design requirements for Illustrations and in particular whether supplementary panphonic texts should be included.},

  abstract = {The papers in this volume address to different degrees issues on the relationship of articles systems and the pragmatic notions of definiteness and specificity in typologically diverse languages: Vietnamese, Siwi (Berber), Russian, Mopan (Mayan), Persian, Danish and Swedish. The main questions that motivate this volume are: (1) How do languages with and without an article system go about helping the hearer to recognize whether a given noun phrase should be interpreted as definite, specific or non-specific? (2) Is there clear-cut semantic definiteness without articles or do we find systematic ambiguity regarding the interpretation of bare noun phrases? (3) If there is ambiguity, can we still posit one reading as the default? (4) What exactly do articles in languages encode that are not analyzed as straightforwardly coding (in)definiteness? (5) Do we find linguistic tools in these languages that are similar to those found in languages without articles? Most contributions report on research on different corpora and elicited data or present the outcome of various experimental studies. One paper presents a diachronic study of the emergence of article systems. On the issue of how languages with and without articles guide the hearer to the conclusion that a given noun phrase should be interpreted as definite, specific or non-specific, the studies in this paper argue for similar strategies. The languages investigated in this volume use constructions and linguistic tools that receive a final interpretation based on discourse prominence considerations and various aspects of the syntax-semantics interface. In case of ambiguity between these readings, the default interpretation is given by factors (e. g., familiarity, uniqueness) that are known to contribute to the salience of phrases, but may be overridden by discourse prominence. Articles that do not straightforwardly mark (in)definiteness encode different kinds of specificity. In the languages studied in this volume, whether they have articles or do not have an article system, we find similar factors and linguistic tools in the calculation process of interpretations. The volume contains revised selected papers from the workshop entitled Specificity, definiteness and article systems across languages held at the 40th Annual Conference of the German Linguistic Society (DGfS), 7-9 March, 2018 at the University of Stuttgart.},

We present a prosodic study of narratives, collected through guided elicitation, and provide a prosodic basis for a focus-based analysis of is. Standard formal semantic approaches to the interpretation of additive particles regard additive particles as focus sensitive, hence the associate of the particle is focal and the focus interpretation (in terms of alternatives) is a significant part in its semantics. This view is considered crosslinguistically valid, although the discussion mostly concerns English. In Hungarian, the focus sensitivity of the additive particle is not directly transparent and needs more elaboration. In the relevant literature, the issue of focus marking with respect to the additive particle is has been insufficiently studied or merely stipulated. In this article, we argue for the importance of a more elaborate study of the prosody-information structure interface in the analysis of Hungarian additive particles. Accordingly, we provide data and its analysis to support our core argument and claims. Our study contributes to the overall understanding and analysis of is and to the general claims about focus marking and focus types in Hungarian. We aim to complement the standard semantic analyses by providing a prosodic analysis supporting the focus-sensitive analysis of is instead of merely stipulating an association with focus. On a more general level, we show that the various readings of additive particles can be explained by taking the prosodic patterns of the relevant constructions into account.},

This category basically falls into semantic properties denoting age, dimension, values, and colours. They also indicate human propensities, physical properties, and speed. Syntactically, adjective typically functions as noun modifiers. However, many adjectives also share features with verbs and/or nouns. This makes adjectives not easy to define. Therefore, morphological and syntactic accounts are required, in addition to semantics, to define the prototypical characteristics of adjectives. This paper has shown that majority of lexemes denoting adjectival properties in Dhao share features with verbs. Although the prefix pa- can be attached to verbs and adjectives to generate causative meaning, adjectives are confined only to the second verb in serial verb construction, instead of being the predicate heads. Further, only four adjectives can function as noun modifiers in their bare forms. These latter adjectives are considered as pure or simple adjectives, while the other nine qualifying for adjectives as ``recategorized'' adjectives.},

It is a member of the Sumba-Hawu subgroup in the Austronesian family and displays an intensive contact with nearby Kupang Malay and the Rote dialects, which also influences the grammar of the language. This grammar has six chapters which mainly describe the phonology, morphology, and syntax of Dhao.00Phonologically, Dhao has 23 native consonants and six vowels. It has an open syllabic system. Lack of morphological operations in the language makes the analysis of syntactic categories challenging. Word classes are defined only through constructions. The only derivational prefix pa- bears a variety of meanings and interacts with other morphological processes. (C)a- partial reduplication applies to both nominal and verbal categories. Furthermore, verbs and adjectives are only distinguishable through serial verb constructions (SVCs).00Syntactically, Dhao has an SVO order. In order to indicate grammatical relations, only co-indexing system applies. Due to mismatch between verb valencies and constructions, valency and transitivity are treated as two disctinct terms in this grammar; valency is semantic and transitivity is syntactic. Clause combining does not always have an overt marking; therefore, intonation is used to identify the conjoined units. SVCs include at most three verbs whose types are based on the semantics of the verbs. This grammar provides an innovative contribution to the tradition of language research and description in Eastern Indonesia and specifically in the Timor Region.},

While most of this early work did not emphasize the importance of constructions to our understanding of either synchronic or diachronic syntax, we do identify earlier examples of work for which the notion of construction was crucial, although not richly developed. The bulk of the chapter then proposes ways in which a constructional perspective/theory allows us to address some of these perceived problems with the study of diachronic syntax, hence providing a research context for the individual studies published in this volume.},

This controversial claim is based on a broad theoretical and evidential foundation with language defined as communication based on symbols rather than grammar. Peirce's theory of signs (semiotics) underpins our analysis with its progression of signs (icon, index and symbol) used to identify artefact forms operating at the level of symbols. We draw on generalisations about the multiple social roles of technology in pre-industrial societies and on the contexts tool-use among non-human primates to argue for a deep evolutionary foundation for hominin symbol use. We conclude that symbol-based language is expressed materially in arbitrary social conventions that permeate the technologies of Homo erectus and its descendants, and in the extended planning involved in the caching of tools and in the early settlement of island Southeast Asia.},

This paper presents data from Ulwa, a Papuan language of the Sepik region of Papua New Guinea, which forms its passive constructions through a syntactic operation. Specifically, passives are formed through the inversion of subject and predicate. Whereas the canonical transitive active sentence in Ulwa has the basic constituent order SOV, the corresponding passive sentence has the order VS, where the S of the passive corresponds to the O of the active. Agent arguments are optional; when they do appear in passive constructions, they are marked as obliques. The Ulwa data support claims that it is possible for passivization to be a syntactic phenomenon that operates on the level of the clause.},

Fast Track returns text files containing acoustic information (formant frequencies, formant bandwidths, fundamental frequency, etc.) sampled every 2 ms, generates images showing the winning analysis and comparing alternate analyses, and creates log files detailing analysis information for each file. Fast Track features a modular workflow that allows for analysis steps to be run (and re-run) independently as necessary, and is designed to allow for easy correction of tracking errors by allowing the user to override the automatic analysis, or manually edit tracks where necessary. In addition, Fast Track includes tools to aggregate data across tokens, and to easily create vowel plots of mean values or time-varying formant contours. The design and use of Fast Track are outlined using a re-analysis of the Hillenbrand et al. (1995) dataset, which suggests that Fast Track can be very accurate in cases where signal properties allow for reliable formant estimates.},

Toronto Working Papers in Linguistics 13:3\textendash 27, 1994; Dresher Talk Presented at Meeting of the Canadian Linguistics Association, University of Ottawa, 1998, Toronto Working Papers in Linguistics 20:47\textendash 62, 2003a, Asymmetry in grammar: Morphology, phonology, acquisition. Amsterdam, Netherlands: Benjamins, Vol. 2, pp. 239\textendash 257, 2003b). In particular, this paper demonstrates that disparities between phonetic characteristics of tones and their phonological activity can be understood as a kind of underspecification that the Contrastive Hierarchy affords. The second goal of this paper is to propose an analysis in which contour tones in Chinese languages generally are represented as unitary entities rather than as a concatenation of level tones (Tone Clusters). This contrasts with the tonal systems found in African languages, in which contour tones are demonstrably composed of level tones. Thus, this paper argues for the existence of two types of contour tones in natural language: unitary contour tones and Tone Clusters.},

It is intended for linguistic researchers preparing to undertake fieldwork, probably documenting one of the world's many small or endangered languages. Recognizing that linguists have their own priorities and methodologies in language documentation and description, this article advances reasons for including in the corpus the song and/or instrumental music that it is almost certain to be encountered in the course of fieldwork carried out. This article begins by providing an overview of current thinking about the nature and significance of human musical capacities and the commonly encountered types, context, and significance of music, especially in relation to language. It comments on the technical and practical requirements for a good musical documentation and how these might differ from language documentation, and also provide some suggestions on a workflow for field production of musical recordings for community use. Examples taken from fieldwork previously carried out are intended to provide food for thought, and not to imply that music and dance traditions in other societies are necessarily structured in comparable ways. Since musical behaviour is so widespread, so dear to human hearts, and so closely allied to language and other communicative codes, linguistic fieldworkers are urged to take advantage of opportunities to work with their community collaborators to record and document music and dance when feasible.},

Recently, Barr, Levy, Scheepers, and Tily 2013 recommended fitting `maximal' models with all possible random effect components included. Estimation of maximal models, however, may not converge. We show that failure to converge typically is not due to a suboptimal estimation algorithm, but is a consequence of attempting to fit a model that is too complex to be properly supported by the data, irrespective of whether estimation is based on maximum likelihood or on Bayesian hierarchical modeling with uninformative or weakly informative priors. Importantly, even under convergence, overparameterization may lead to uninterpretable models. We provide diagnostic tools for detecting overparameterization and guiding model simplification.},

  abstract = {The main objective of the paper is to show that for an adequate analysis of an item's information status in spoken language two levels of givenness have to be investigated: a referential and a lexical level. This separation is a crucial step towards our goal to arrive at the best possible classification of nominal expressions occurring in natural discourse which reflects our understanding of all important aspects related to an item's givenness or novelty (``information status'').  For that purpose, we first introduce our motivation for this division which stems from the observation that both levels of information status have an influence on an item's prosodic marking.  Section 2 presents basic concepts including the cognitive dimensions which have been discussed in the literature on givenness, in particular the role of knowledge, consciousness and (un)importance. In Section 3, we give an overview of influential proposals to classify and order the various concepts. In doing so, we explain and relate the most important concepts that play a role in classifying nominal expressions: coreference, bridging, inference, hearer knowledge, indexicality, embeddedness. A number of paradoxes and inconsistencies of the presented approaches are discussed, which can be resolved by the insight that there are two different notions of givenness which apply to expressions of different syntactic-semantic type. We refer to them as referential givenness (r-givenness) and lexical givenness ({$\mkern1mu$}l-givenness), and provide the semantic basis for these two concepts. In Section 4, we propose a fine-grained two-level annotation scheme for the analysis of an item's information status, called the RefLex scheme. Section 5 takes a closer look at the prosody of the proposed labels in combination and develops a couple of hypotheses which are tested in two small exemplary corpora of spontaneous and read German speech.},

Both at the referential and at the lexical level not only given and new but also intermediate classes of givenness/novelty have to be distinguished. We provide a brief introduction to our two-dimensional RefLex annotation scheme and discuss its application to a number of examples from the theoretical literature which cannot be described satisfactorily by means of previous annotation schemes. From these examples we derive hypotheses on the relationship between information status and accent position as well as accent type. The hypotheses are generally confirmed for read speech showing a stepwise increase in prosodic prominence from given to new items, predominantly ordered according to the information status at the lexical level. The results of the relationship between prosody and information status are found to be less clear in spontaneous speech, probably due to the production of shorter intonation phrases reducing the variability of accentuation in marking different levels of givenness.},

Since a prototypical noun phrase contains a determiner and a head noun, this paper describes the nouns in Ibanag. Using a 250,000-word religious and literary Ibanag texts, the following properties of nominals have been presented: number, gender, and morphological formation. There are two ways of pluralization process in Ibanag: the use of the plural marker ira and reduplication. Aside from the gender, the properties of common nouns, and the borrowed ones, there are eight types of derived nouns discussed in this paper.},

  abstract = {Recent discussions of annotator agreement have mostly centered around its calculation and interpretation, and the correct choice of indices. Although these discussions are important, they only consider the ``back-end'' of the story, namely, what to do once the data are collected. Just as important in our opinion is to know how agreement is reached in the first place and what factors influence coder agreement as part of the annotation process or setting, as this knowledge can provide concrete guidelines for the planning and set-up of annotation projects. To investigate whether there are factors that consistently impact annotator agreement we conducted a meta-analytic investigation of annotation studies reporting agreement percentages. Our meta-analysis synthesized factors reported in 96 annotation studies from three domains (word-sense disambiguation, prosodic transcriptions, and phonetic transcriptions) and was based on a total of 346 agreement indices. Our analysis identified seven factors that influence reported agreement values: annotation domain, number of categories in a coding scheme, number of annotators in a project, whether annotators received training, the intensity of annotator training, the annotation purpose, and the method used for the calculation of percentage agreements. Based on our results we develop practical recommendations for the assessment, interpretation, calculation, and reporting of coder agreement. We also briefly discuss theoretical implications for the concept of annotation quality.},

Contextual probability had an effect on hesitation even when word frequency was held constant, but word frequency had no effect when contextual probability was controlled. Analysis of certain types of errors, also, revealed that word frequency may play an important role in the lexical selection process.},

This way of thinking offers a new perspective on diverse phenomena, including the projection of presuppositions, association with focus, contrastive topic marking, and variability of projection behavior. We review the principal issues and prior lines of research in each of these areas, and show how the issues may be recast in QUD terms.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a new perspective on the options available to languages for encoding directed motion events. Talmy (2000) introduces an influential two-way typology, proposing that languages adopt either verb- or satellite-framed encoding of motion events. This typology is augmented by Slobin (2004b) and Zlatev \& Yangklang (2004) with a third class of equipollently-framed languages. We propose that the observed options can instead be attributed to: (i) the motion-independent morphological, lexical, and syntactic resources languages make available for encoding manner and path of motion, (ii) the role of the verb as the single clause-obligatory lexical category that can encode either manner or path, and (iii) extra-grammatical factors that yield preferences for certain options. Our approach accommodates the growing recognition that most languages straddle more than one of the previously proposed typological categories: a language may show both verb- and satellite-framed patterns, or if it allows equipollent-framing, even all three patterns. We further show that even purported verb-framed languages may not only allow but actually prefer satellite-framed patterns when appropriate contextual support is available, a situation unexpected if a two- or three-way typology is assumed. Finally, we explain the appeal of previously proposed two- and three-way typologies: they capture the encoding options predicted to be preferred once certain external factors are recognized, including complexity of expression and biases in lexical inventories.},

A series of acoustic and perceptual experiments was conducted on the prenasalized stops of the Bantu language Ikalanga. The main acoustic cues differentiating prenasalized stops (NC) from plain nasals (N) were a short post-nasal oral closure for NC and heavy coarticulatory vowel nasalization following N. Independent manipulation of these cues showed that Ikalanga listeners used both segmental and coarticulatory timing in identifying NC vs. N, although carryover coarticulatory nasalization was both a sufficient and necessary cue for the distinction. Comparable weighting of anticipatory nasalization was not found for tests of the N C-C distinction, although this different perceptual outcome is in keeping with Ikalanga acoustic patterns.},

  abstract = {Much recent work on the syntax-prosody interface has been based in Optimality Theory. The typical analysis explicitly considers only a small number of candidates that could reasonably be expected to be optimal under some ranking, often without an explicit definition of GEN. Manually generating all the possible candidates, however, is prohibitively time-consuming for most input structures \textendash{} the Too Many Candidates Problem. Existing software for OT uses regular expressions for automated generation and evaluation of candidates. However, regular expressions are too low in the Chomsky Hierarchy of language types to represent trees of arbitrary size, which are needed for syntax-prosody work. This paper presents a new computational tool for research in this area: Syntax-Prosody in Optimality Theory (SPOT). For a given input, SPOT generates all prosodic parses under certain assumptions about GEN, and evaluates them against all constraints in CON. This allows for in-depth comparison of the typological predictions made by different theories of GEN and CON at the syntax-prosody interface.},

In this article, we focus on emphasis for intensity, a general linguistic strategy whereby linguistic objects are given prominence by virtue of being selected from the upper range of a scale. We consider two linguistic domains where emphasis for intensity can be observed: the lexical domain, where it is conveyed via a variety of intensifiers, and the domain of syntax, where it can be conveyed via different types of non-canonical word order. While distinct in many respects, such families of constructions can be seen as conveying a unified effect, raising a number of issues concerning how the relation between emphasis and scalarity is best captured across languages and constructions.},

In two phases, Study 1 (N = 317) sought to validate a new instrument assessing students' perceptions of teachers' autonomy support and control when presenting mastery goals. Study 2 (N = 1,331) demonstrated that at both within- and between-classroom levels, perceptions of teachers' autonomy support for mastery goals were related to students' mastery goals' endorsement and behavioral engagement. These relations were mediated by students' autonomous reasons to pursue learning activities. Perceptions of teachers' control predicted disengagement through controlled reasons for learning, but only at the within-classroom level. This research joins a growing body of work demonstrating that combining achievement goal theory with SDT can further our understanding of the underpinnings of achievement motivation. It suggests that if teachers want their students to endorse mastery goals (and be more engaged), they need to use more autonomy supportive practices and less controlling ones.},

Specific topics discussed in detail include the identification of prosodic domains, the universality of prosodic categories, the recent resurgence of interest in the role of recursion in prosodic structure, crosslinguistic variation in syntax\textendash prosody mapping, prosodic influences on syntax and word order, and the influence of sentence processing in the planning and shaping of prosodic domains. We consider criticisms of prosodic hierarchy theory in particular, and provide an assessment of the future of prosodic hierarchy theory in research on the syntax\textendash prosody interface.},

In our sample, all languages with more than 50\% second language speakers had no nominal case. Te negative association between the number of second language speakers and nominal case complexity generalizes to different language areas and families. As there are many studies attesting to the difficulty of acquiring morphological case in second language acquisition, this result supports the idea that languages adapt to the cognitive constraints of their speakers, as well as to the sociolinguistic niches of their speaking communities. We discuss our results with respect to sociolinguistic typology and the Linguistic Niche Hypothesis, as well as with respect to qualitative data from historical linguistics. All in all, multiple lines of evidence converge on the idea that morphosyntactic complexity is reduced by a high degree of language contact involving adult learners.},

Then they discuss a potential future for language archiving, that of the participatory model of language archiving, which is radically user-centered and draws on trends in the archival sciences. Next they present some of the extant archives for language documentation, the members of the Digital Endangered Languages and Music Archiving Network. Finally, because archiving is an activity that is now available to anyone undertaking endangered-language work, they close by presenting the steps one would take to work with an archive to deposit one's own materials.},

This study, in contrast, addresses the syntagmatic dimension and in particular examines the effect of token frequency on serial order. A simple prediction follows from the psycholinguistic observation that frequency facilitates the retrieval of linguistic units: frequent units should precede infrequent ones rather than vice versa in the linear representation of speech. This prediction is tested on a total of fourteen phenomena from various languages and found to receive wide support in the domain of word order. However, it exerts only a sporadic influence on morpheme order and apparently no influence on phoneme order. Frequency is argued to be a costfree, explanatory and pervasive, albeit a relatively weak factor. It is most likely to manifest itself in areas where alternative ordering options are available which are also semantically similar. Frequency may accompany linguistic change through its various stages.},

In this report, we outline a construction formalism that is both representationally adequate for these purposes and specified precisely enough for use in a computational architecture.},

It points out that the driving question of this framework is how language is used in actual physical and social contexts, and explains that ECG is an attempt to computationally model the cognitive and neural mechanisms that underlie human linguistic behavior. The chapter evaluates the role of mental simulation in processing and outlines how language can be seen as in interface to simulation. It also shows how constructions are represented in ECG and describes an ECG-based model of language comprehension.},

  abstract = {Interactional approaches to prosody have seen an enormous growth in the last decades. One crucial assumption common to these approaches is that prosodic devices may serve as resources for structuring and organizing an interaction. Methodologically, interactionally informed research of prosody rests upon ethnomethodological conversation analysis and contextualization theory. In this paper, a case study of the Cologne German rising-falling intonation contour serves to illuminate the prevalent methods in the field. The results are discussed with respect to their implications for basic theoretical assumptions about prosody and intonation. Consistent with core assumptions of Interactional Linguistics, they point to the variable and gradient nature of intonational functions that can best be captured in a grammar model that allows for holistic descriptions of linguistic structures.},

As the title of the volume suggests, part of this exploration consists of situating already established notions (such as evidentiality) with the diversity of systems found in individual languages. Epistemic forms that feature in the present volume include ones that signal how speakers claim knowledge based on perceptual-cognitive access (evidentials); the speaker's involvement as a basis for claiming epistemic authority (egophorics); the distribution of knowledge between the speech-participants where the speaker signals assumptions about the addressee's knowledge of an event as either shared, or non-shared with the speaker (engagement marking).},

Instead of limiting agreement to the unification of features of the agreement trigger with those of the target, TibetoBurman languages also allow NP features to combine with the features marked by the agreement morphology in an appositional (`as NP'), partitional (`NP of') or relational (`NP with regard to') structure. This possibility is shown to result from an associative principle in the syntax-semantics interface underlying Tibeto-Burman, and more generally Sino-Tibetan grammar, which is distinct from the more integrative design of Indo-European languages. These differences also manifest themselves in grammatical relations structure, role semantics, and discourse tendencies.},

Despite their importance, demonstrating such patterns remains a challenge. This chapter argues that large-scale area hypotheses are better tested by modeling diachronic family biases than by controlling for genealogical relations in regression models. A case study of the Trans-Pacific area reveals that diachronic bias estimates do not depend much on the amount of phylogenetic information that is used when inferring them. After controlling for false discovery rates, about 39 variables in WALS and AUTOTYP show diachronic biases that differ significantly inside vs. outside the Trans-Pacific area. Nearly three times as many biases hold outside than inside the Trans-Pacific area, indicating that the Trans-Pacific area is not so much characterized by the spread of biases but rather by the retention of earlier diversity, in line with earlier suggestions in the literature.},

We then determine to what extent these roles are treated alike across languages, i.e. repeatedly grouped together under the same non-default case marker or under the same specific alternation with a non-default marker. Applying fuzzy cluster and NeighborNet algorithms to these data reveals cross-linguistic evidence for role clusters around experiencers, undergoers of body processes, and cognizers/perceivers in one- and two-place predicates; and around sources and transmitted speech in three-place predicates. No support emerges from non-default case assignment for any other role clusters that are traditionally assumed (e.g. for any distinctions among objects of two-argument predicates, or for distinctions between themes and instruments).},

  abstract = {The transcription bottleneck is often cited as a major obstacle for efforts to document the world's endangered languages and supply them with language technologies. One solution is to extend methods from automatic speech recognition and machine translation, and recruit linguists to provide narrow phonetic transcriptions and sentence-aligned translations. However, I believe that these approaches are not a good fit with the available data and skills, or with long-established practices that are essentially word-based. In seeking a more effective approach, I consider a century of transcription practice and a wide range of computational approaches, before proposing a computational model based on spoken term detection that I call ``sparse transcription.'' This represents a shift away from current assumptions that we transcribe phones, transcribe fully, and transcribe first. Instead, sparse transcription combines the older practice of word-level transcription with interpretive, iterative, and interactive processes that are amenable to wider participation and that open the way to new methods for processing oral languages.},

  abstract = {In this paper we explore articulatory timing in the glottalised resonant series of St'\'at'imcets, an Interior Salish language spoken in British Columbia, Canada. We show that while these sounds form a natural class phonologically (van Eijk, 1997), they behave as two distinct classes phonetically: [-sonorant] segments /\OE{} \textparagraph/ are systematically pre-glottalised. In contrast, [+sonorant] segments / ,, \texttrademark{} ' j' \textordfeminine{} {$^1$}/ are post-glottalised word-finally, and intervocalically glottalisation overlaps with the oral articulation. We propose that articulatory timing in complex segments in subject not only to positional effects (Gick, 2003; Krakow, 1993; Silverman, 1995; Steriade, 1997), but also consonantal effects. We further propose that these effects are due to articulatory and biomechanical restrictions on speech, and need not be linguistically encoded.},

We begin by reviewing current uses of software tools and digital technologies for language documentation and description. This sheds light on how digital language documentation and description are created and managed, leading to an analysis of seven portability problems under the following headings: content, format, discovery, access, citation, preservation and rights. After characterizing each problem we provide a series of value statements, and this provides the framework for a broad range of best practice recommendations.},

It is therefore critical that we question vague conceptions of the field as value-neutral or universally beneficial, and investigate what specific values the field is advancing. In this paper, we present a rigorous examination of the values of the field by quantitatively and qualitatively analyzing 100 highly cited ML papers published at premier ML conferences, ICML and NeurIPS. We annotate key features of papers which reveal their values: how they justify their choice of project, which aspects they uplift, their consideration of potential negative consequences, and their institutional affiliations and funding sources. We find that societal needs are typically very loosely connected to the choice of project, if mentioned at all, and that consideration of negative consequences is extremely rare. We identify 67 values that are uplifted in machine learning research, and, of these, we find that papers most frequently justify and assess themselves based on performance, generalization, efficiency, researcher understanding, novelty, and building on previous work. We present extensive textual evidence and analysis of how these values are operationalized. Notably, we find that each of these top values is currently being defined and applied with assumptions and implications generally supporting the centralization of power. Finally, we find increasingly close ties between these highly cited papers and tech companies and elite universities.},

The ability to parse conversational speech depends crucially on the ability to identify boundaries between prosodic phrases. This is done naturally by the human ear, yet has proved surprisingly difficult to achieve reliably and simply in an automatic manner. Efforts to date have focused on detecting phrase boundaries using a variety of linguistic and acoustic cues. We propose a method which does not require model training and utilizes two prosodic cues that are based on ASR output. Boundaries are identified using discontinuities in speech rate (pre-boundary lengthening and phrase-initial acceleration) and silent pauses. The resulting phrases preserve syntactic validity, exhibit pitch reset, and compare well with manual tagging of prosodic boundaries. Collectively, our findings support the notion of prosodic phrases that represent coherent patterns across textual and acoustic parameters.},

This will be shown on the basis of structural-conceptual criteria as those developed by Croft (2000) and Sasse (1993b) as well as on the basis of methodological criteria as those suggested by Evans \& Osada (2005). As is claimed in Construction Grammar (Goldberg 1995, 2005), the meaning of lexical items is derived by integrating their own lexical meaning with the meaning contributed by the construction. The construction analysed in this paper is the argument structure construction. Linking between lexicon and syntax is subject to stereotypical pragmatic implicatures (Levinson 2000) that follow a version of the animacy hierarchy. As it will turn out, Late Archaic Chinese does not strictly lack parts of speech. In fact, without the distinction of nouns and verbs at the level of syntax it would not be possible to analyse utterances in Late Archaic Chinese. The only thing that Late Archaic Chinese can do without is noun/verb distinction in the lexicon. This typologically remarkable property is due to a process of morphological change. If such a historical process can take place irrespective of parts-of-speech distinctions, precategoriality in the lexicon cannot be a robust universal feature even if most theoretical approaches take it for granted.},

In a critical discussion of this approach, this article will then address the following three issues. (i) The concept of single eventhood is a more general concept from which a number of Aikhenvald and Dixon's (2006) criteria can be iconically derived. The macro-event property and time-positional operators (Bohnemeyer et al. 2007) provide a good basis for a more coherent definition of what makes an event as far as events are independent of cultural factors. (ii) Some languages like Kalam also use the morphosyntactic expression format of serialization for discourse purposes. Because the narrative use of that construction clearly violates single eventhood, it should not be discussed as an instance of SVC. (iii) Historically, the unmarked juxtaposition of verbs can induce processes of grammaticalization and lexicalization. This article ends with the question of how far the label of `serial verb construction' actually refers to a cross-linguistically coherent phenomenon.},

It will start out from the observation that East and mainland Southeast Asian languages (EMSEA) with their reduced or absent morphology are radical pro-drop, while West African Niger-Congo languages with similarly reduced or absent morphology have obligatory subject and object arguments. The reason for this is that the ancestor languages of Niger-Congo had a morphological paradigm expressing the features of [person] and [number] on the verb, while the ancestor languages of EMSEA had not. It will be argued that the existence of morphological paradigms keeps the frequency of [person] and [number] features above the critical percentage of 20\textendash 30\% for linguistic change (s-curve model, Wang \& Cheng 1970) and thus blocks the change from non-pro-drop to radical pro-drop in the West African languages concerned by passing on the frequency of the former morphological features to syntax and obligatory pronouns. In EMSEA languages, there is no morphological paradigm that pushes the frequency of these features up to the percentage that would be necessary for a change to non-pro-drop.},

Both of them have a special status in typology and linguistic theory. Radical analyticity is known under the term of `morphological isolation' and has recently been described as `diachronically anomalous' (McWhorter 2016), while radical pro-drop is a theoretical challenge since Rizzi (1986). The present paper offers an alternative view on these characteristics based on data from EMSEA languages, radically analytic West African languages and pidgins and creoles. It develops diachronic evolutionary scenarios combining the specific properties of languages in their diachronic and geographic situations with two different notions of complexity (hidden vs. overt complexity) and factors which tend to block the development of inflectional morphological paradigms. From such a perspective, radical analyticity and radical pro-drop are by no means extraordinary. Given the enormous size of the task, the paper is a thought experiment based on available data and discussions on the above languages for stimulating further research.},

  abstract = {Dialectologists and typologists both deal with linguistic variation and have more to say to each other than has been realised in the past. If the definition of dialect vs. language is based on extra-linguistic social factors, nothing can be predicted concerning the degree of structural variation between dialects, and thus there is no principled reason why to exclude data from dialects into typology. Findings from dialectology are of particular interest for the approach of integrative functionalism (Croft 1995) which assumes that individual speakers select the variant to be used in a particular situation according to social criteria. If this approach is extended to the level of distributional patterns of linguistic types across languages, models such as social networks (Milroy and Milroy 1985), leaders of linguistic change (Labov 2001) or the invisible hand (Keller 1990) have a lot to contribute to our understanding of how these patterns came about. Models such as these are particularly important in a situation in which typologists cannot rely on the statistical neutrality of the distribution of types within the population of the world's languages (Maslova 2000). Studies on linguistic variation are incomplete without the incorporation of language contact and its consequences. Language contact can promote the emergence of new types and it may turn out to be a challenge for Maslova's (2000) approach to the problem of statistical neutrality. Multidimensional scaling as developed in dialectology may be a possible way out of this problem. The integration of typology, dialectology and contact linguistics may open new perspectives for research dealing with linguistic variation and what we can learn from variation about the human brain.},

Deductive research is based on a theory, on the basis of which hypotheses can be formulated and tested against the background of empirical data. Looking at the state-of-the-art in translation studies, either theories as well as models are designed or empirical data are collected and interpreted. However, the final step is still lacking: so far, empirical data has not lead to the formulation of theories or models, whereas existing theories and models have not yet been comprehensively tested with empirical methods.{$<$}br{$>$}  {$<$}br{$>$} This publication addresses these issues from several perspectives: multi-method product- as well as process-based research may gain insights into translation as well as interpreting phenomena. These phenomena may include cognitive and organizational processes, procedures and strategies, competence and performance, translation properties and universals, etc. Empirical findings about the deeper structures of translation and interpreting will reduce the gap between translation and interpreting practice and model and theory building. Furthermore, the availability of more large-scale empirical testing triggers the development of models and theories concerning translation and interpreting phenomena and behavior based on quantifiable, replicable and transparent data.},

Changes in diet attributable to food-processing technologies modified the human bite from an edge-to-edge configuration to one that preserves adolescent overbite and overjet into adulthood. This change favored the emergence and maintenance of labiodentals. Our findings suggest that language is shaped not only by the contingencies of its history, but also by culturally induced changes in human biology.},

The languages of the sea nomads in Island SE Asia fall into three major groups, Samalic or Sama-Bajaw, the Orang Laut of Eastern Sumatra and the Riau islands, and the Moken/Moklen complex of the Andaman Sea, west of Thailand and Myanmar. All of these are Austronesian, the great phylum of languages which originated in Taiwan more than five thousand years ago. Less well understood are the river nomads of Borneo and the `sea peoples' of the China coast. There is reason to believe the Borneo peoples spring from the same upsurge of mercantile innovation as their seagoing cousins. However, the Chinese groups seem to have limited interaction with the ISEA networks and presumably have a quite different origin. Today they speak no unusual languages, but the antiquity of cross-straits interaction argues that their roots may well lie far in the past.},

This suggests that regions can be characterised by negative typology, i.e., the absence of globally common traits. Conversely, typological uniformity occurs in mainland Southeast Asia, a region notable for the similarities between language structures. An expansion of the remit of typology can uncover large regional patterns which can be tied to the archaeological narrative of the early expansion of modern humans.},

  abstract = {Scholars have been diligent since the Renaissance in tracing the etymologies of Latin words, but it is safe to say they have generally not looked at areas as remote as Melanesia. However, there is reason to think that at least one root, musa, for the banana family may have originated there, in the Papuan languages affiliated with the Trans New Guinea phylum. The paper presents evidence that the root \#mugu, or something similar, is deeply embedded in the TNG and was borrowed from there to Austronesian, and made its way into Dravidian via the commerce routes across the Bay of Bengal. The term became something like *mottai in Dravidian was borrowed into Sanskrit, and thence into Persian, eventually showing up in Latin. It also appears in languages of Nepal, probably borrowed from Indo-Aryan and the Tangkhulic languages of Myanmar, which appear to be directly cognate with Dravidian. The Palaungic languages of Myanmar appear to also have a cognate of the Indo-Aryan root. From India, the root travelled west, borrowed into Farsi, Arabic, late Greek and Latin. Via Arabic, the root also made its way down the Red Sea, and to the Horn of Africa, where it appears in Amharic and Somali. A Swahili attestation is probably a direct borrowing from Farsi.},

  abstract = {The Bashiic [=Batanic] group of languages includes Tao [=Yami], Itbayat and the dialects of Ivatan, and is spoken on islands in the strait between Southern Taiwan and the Philippines (Ross 2005). Bashiic is something of a mystery, since in general its members are very close to one another, and yet it is apparently a primary branch of Western Malayopolynesian. Ross (2005) suggests that for some reason the nuclear language was isolated from developments in the remainder of the Philippines. Bashiic presents a paradox; although the languages are very close together, the evidence is the islands in this region have been settled for some 4000 years, i.e. at the point where the speakers of PMP left Taiwan (see Tsang 2005 for Lanyu, Mijares et al. 2003 for Itbayat, Bellwood \& Dizon (2014) for the Batanes. A study of the Bashiic lexicon reveals a problem. The Tao language shares too much with Ivatan to question the existence of a Bashiic group and is also clearly PMP. Yet much cultural and economic vocabulary is both exotic, different from Ivatan and not obviously Austronesian. How can this be explained? The Batanes islands have been occupied for a long time, and it seems likely that they were first settled from Taiwan some 4000 years ago. We do not know how long Lanyu (and Green Island) have been settled, but given the crossing of the Taiwan Strait and the navigational capacities of the early speakers of PMP languages, it seems likely this would also have been Neolithic at the very least. As Lanyu oral traditions record, only one village actually acknowledges a link with the Batanes. However, this link was probably important, as settlers from the Batanes, probably Itbayat, may have crossed to Lanyu relatively recently. They seem to have established cultural dominance over the existing residents, to the extent that their language disappeared and was replace by Tao.},

  author = {Blench, Roger and Cb, Cambridge},
  pages = {22},
  abstract = {The ancient vegecultural systems of Melanesia and the rice-dominated agriculture of mainland and island SE Asia presently appear to be worlds apart. In particular, models of the Neolithic on the mainland are dominated by our understanding of the dates for the appearance of rice. But new research in Arunachal Pradesh and Borneo is beginning to challenge this understanding. It now appears that, apart from the pseudo-grain Job's tears, all types of cereal agriculture in Arunachal Pradesh are relatively recent, as are domestic animals other than the semi-wild mithun. The basis of subsistence for many societies was the tubers, yam, aroids and others, the bananas, sugar-cane, sago and the cabbage of tree-ferns. In addition, the management of bamboos and rattans was essential to daily life, while foraging continues to play a major role in subsistence. Sago remains an important staple for some populations in Eastern Indonesia and Borneo, and the evidence is, despite a single find of rice, that such cereals are of recent introduction. Linguistic evidence has begun to suggest that vegecultural staples such as the bananas had spread far west from Melanesia well before the Austronesian expansion. In addition, there are striking similarities in material culture between these regions. Both Borneo and Arunachal Pradesh are notable for the construction of longhouses for multiple families, for the ritual importance of the hornbill. NE India shares with Melanesia very large slitgongs and string, `bilum' bags of identical design. All of this suggests that prior to the advent of cereals, an arc of vegeculture once existed over the whole region from Melanesia to NE India and that this is reflected in other shared cultural characteristics,.},

The paper suggests that this is supported by neither linguistics, archaeology nor the distribution of material culture. Archaeology of ISEA after 4000 BP points to near simultaneous settlement in a wide variety of sites, while analysis of individual lexical items points to geographically biased distributions, suggesting they were selectively carried to different regions. Distributions of material culture items associated exclusively with Austronesian culture show strong geographical biases. Recent phenotypic results from Remote Oceania suggests a direct connection with some populations of Taiwan and Northern Luzon, contrary to previous models of complex mixing at intermediate stages, calling into question elaborate nested models of Austronesian phylogeny. This points to a rather different model of time and place, here called the `boiling pot' which assumes the Luzon Strait was an centre of innovative maritime technology and the starting point for voyages in canoes with multi-ethnic crews. This would then see PMP as a network of related subgroups, which can never fully reconstitute a unitary PMP, because no such entity existed.},

This is in line with the current archaeological dates for settlement in Madagascar which fall within the period 5-7th centuries AD. The role of the Malay in this process, as the protagonists with experience of open ocean voyaging may well explain why Malagasy terms in this lexical field are all Malay borrowings.

The reclassification of these constructions highlights a typological contrast between two types of verbal diathesis and clarifies the status of putative `passives of unaccusatives' and `transitive passives' in Balto-Finnic and Balto-Slavic. Impersonal verb forms differ from passives in two key respects: they are insensitive to the argument structure of a verb and can be formed from unergatives or unaccusatives, and they may retain direct objects. As with other subjectless forms of personal verbs, there is a strong tendency to interpret the suppressed subject of an impersonal as an indefinite human agent. Hence impersonalization is often felicitous only for verbs that select human subjects.},

Over 90\% of all lexical bases in Proto-Austronesian and other early Austronesian proto-languages are disyllabic. This dominant pattern, which was transmitted to most of the 1200-plus Austronesian languages spoken today, has tended repeatedly to reassert itself in forms that have come to have other than two syllables. As a structurally defined target that is satisfied by diverse historical changes, this preferential disyllabism can be considered an `attractor' in the sense of Kelso (1995). Perhaps the most interesting consequence of disyllabic attractors in Austronesian historical phonology is the widespread occurrence of syncope only between identical consonants, a pattern that Odden (1988) has characterised in synchronic systems as one of `anti-antigemination'.},

In the course of the AN diaspora over a period of several millennia these languages have come into contact with many others, and because of both contact and internal dynamics of change, have developed a wide variety of innovative typological features. Despite the great potential that they offer the general typologist or theoretician, and the considerable quantity of specialist literature that now exists, AN languages have remained surprisingly marginal in generalist discussions of the nature of language and of language change.},

  abstract = {The Kenyah languages of central Borneo form a distinct unit within the North Sarawak group of Austronesian languages. In northern Sarawak there is a welldefined contrast between types that have been called `Highland Kenyah' and `Lowland Kenyah'. A key difference between these sets of closely-related languages is the reflexes of Proto-North Sarawak/Proto-Kenyah *b, *d, *j, *g and *bh, *dh, *jh, *gh, which are distinguished (usually as b, d, j, g vs. p, t, c, k ) in Highland Kenyah, but show a complex set of innovations in some varieties of Lowland Kenyah. The most striking of these changes in the dialect spoken by the Lebu' Vu' Kenyah at Long Sela'an and Long Ikang, and the Long Tikan Kenyah at Long San, is the shift of voiced aspirates to phonetic implosives that were generalized to the reflexes of *b, *d, *j, *g as final syllable onsets, leading to merger of the two series. Because it was conditioned, this merger produced complementation between [b]/[ɓ], [{$\Elzdyogh$}]/[ɗj], and [g]/[ɠ] (*d lenited before implosion was generalized, preventing merger). Most remarkably, the reduction of Proto-Kenyah nasalobstruent clusters in these dialects has begun to produce new instances of [{$\Elzdyogh$}] and [g], but not [b] and [d], producing contrastive implosives only at palatal and velar positions, a reversal of the distributional preference commonly associated with implosive stops in cross-linguistic perspective.},

This paper presents 96 sound correspondences, mainly between the two Western Kho-Bwa varieties Duhumbi and Khoitam, with           additional evidence from other Western Kho-Bwa varieties and other Tibeto-Burman languages whenever deemed illustrative. On basis of these           sound correspondences, I propose 282 Western Kho-Bwa proto-forms including a total of 92 onsets. The less common reconstructed Western           Kho-Bwa onsets are the uvular onsets and the voiceless nasal and approximant onsets.             A unique innovation of the Western Kho-Bwa languages, and indeed the Kho-Bwa languages in general, is the correspondence           of initial *s- in other Tibeto-Burman languages to a vocal onset in Proto-Western Kho-Bwa and its descendent varieties.

It has been argued, on the basis of a button-press experiment [De Ruiter, J. P., Mitterer, H., \& Enfield, N. J. (2006). Projecting the end of a speaker's turn: A cognitive cornerstone of conversation. Language, 82(3):515\textendash 535], that participants in conversation rely mainly on lexico-syntactic information when timing and producing their turns, and that they do not need to make use of intonational cues to achieve smooth transitions and avoid overlaps. In contrast to this view, but in line with previous observational studies, our results from a dialogue task and a button-press task involving questions and answers indicate that the identification of the end of intonational phrases is necessary for smooth turn-taking. In both tasks, participants never responded to questions (i.e., gave an answer or pressed a button to indicate a turn end) at turn-internal points of syntactic completion in the absence of an intonational phrase boundary. Moreover, in the button-press task, they often pressed the button at the same point of syntactic completion when the final word of an intonational phrase was cross-spliced at that location. Furthermore, truncated stimuli ending in a syntactic completion point but lacking an intonational phrase boundary led to significantly delayed button presses. In light of these results, we argue that earlier claims that intonation is not necessary for correct turn-end projection are misguided, and that research on turn-taking should continue to consider intonation as a source of turn-end cues along with other linguistic and communicative phenomena.},

  abstract = {The Mayan languages Tzeltal and Yucatec have large form classes of ``dispositional'' roots which lexicalize spatial properties such as orientation, support/suspension/blockage of motion, and configurations of parts of an entity with respect to other parts. But speakers of the two languages deploy this common lexical resource quite di\textcurrency erently. The roots are used in both languages to convey dispositional information (e.g., answering ``how'' questions), but Tzeltal speakers also use them in canonical locative descriptions (e.g., answering ``where'' questions), whereas Yucatec speakers only use dispositionals in locative predications when prompted by the context to focus on dispositional properties. We describe the constructions used in locative and dispositional descriptions in response to two di\textcurrency erent picture stimuli sets. Evidence against the proposal that Tzeltal uses dispositionals to compensate for its single, semantically generic preposition (Brown 1994; Grinevald 2006) comes from the finding that Tzeltal speakers use relational spatial nominals in the ``Ground phrase'' \textemdash{} the expression of the place at which an entity is located \textemdash{} about as frequently as Yucatec speakers. We consider several alternative hypotheses, including a possible larger typological di\textcurrency erence that leads Tzeltal speakers, but not Yucatec speakers, to prefer ``theme-specific'' verbs not just in locative predications, but in any predication involving a theme argument.},

In this article, we discuss a series of exceptions to this alignment pattern, drawing on data from eleven populations of Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North and Central America, and Oceania. These exceptions have not been discussed in conjunction with one another and the striking commonalities across the findings of these studies have gone unnoticed: (a) in discourses referring to small-scale space, either intrinsic frame use is dominant or both relative and geocentric frames are used frequently in addition to intrinsic frames; and (b) in recall/recognition memory, geocentric coding is more common than egocentric coding (in tasks that involve stationary stimulus configurations) in nine of the populations, while in the remaining two, there is evidence of extensive intrinsic coding even in nonverbal cognition. We discuss these findings in light of Haun's innate geocentrism hypothesis (Haun, D. B. M., C. Rapold, J. Call, G. Janzen \& S. C. Levinson. 2006. Cognitive cladistics and cultural override in hominid spatial cognition. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 103(46). 17568\textendash 17573).

An examination of English infinitival complements, Ewe serial verb constructions, and Japanese converb constructions suggests that the putative crosslinguistic ``macro-event phrase'' is the verbal core of the Layered Structure of the Clause theory of Role and Reference Grammar. Across languages, simple cores necessarily have the MEP, whereas complex cores have it if and only if they are integrated by `cosubordinate' nexus, defined as a symmetric union of two cores that together behave like a single core. We furthermore argue that this connection between core cosubordinations and the MEP may help explain why cosubordinate cores seem to always share an argument through control.},

Its attractiveness has possibly been due to two factors: to our tendency to think up easy examples, which are apt to have semantically barren words like man whose reference systems are close to their grammatical categories, and to the suggestive power of classical syllogisms. One proof of failure is that instead of clearing up ambiguity the transformation creates it. There is a clear functional difference between predicative modification and attributive modification. Two solutions are offered to account for the restrictions. The first is that be predications in so far as they are involved at all are of the aspectual type bentemp which selects adjectives whose meanings can have a temporal spread. The second is that two types of generation be recognized, one, termed reference-modification, being in the kernel and allowing for a 'kind of' slot among the determiners, the other, termed referent-modification, being by way of a predication which is joined by conjunction rather than by subordination.},

  abstract = {One of the main symptoms of cluttering is atypical pausing. However, there is little information about what this atypical pausing means, because typical speakers also have pauses not only at syntactic boundaries, but also within syntactic structures, and even within words. The aim of this study is to analyse how pausing strategies of persons who clutter (PWCs) differ from pausing strategies of normal speakers and speakers with exceptionally rapid speech (ERSs). Results show that there is a difference between the groups in the frequency and/or duration of pauses and the place of their occurrences. ERSs have less and longer pauses than PWCs and control speakers. There is difference between PWCs and control speakers only in the duration of pauses. The results contribute to the assessment, diagnosis, and therapy of cluttering.},

With respect to genealogy, we focus on the subclassification of Indo-Aryan, the most ubiquitous language family of South Asia. The intent here is methodological: we explore computational methods for visualizing large datasets of linguistic features, in our case 63 features from 200 languages representing four language families of South Asia, coming out of a digitized version of Grierson's Linguistic Survey of India. To this dataset we apply phylogenetic software originally developed in the context of computational biology for clustering the languages and displaying the clusters in the form of networks. We further explore multiple correspondence analysis as a way of illustrating how linguistic feature bundles correlate with extrinsically defined groupings of languages (genealogical and geographical). Finally, map visualization of combinations of linguistic features and language genealogy is suggested as an aid in distinguishing genealogical and areal features. On the whole, our results are in line with the conclusions of earlier studies: Areality and genealogy are strongly intertwined in South Asia, the traditional lower-level subclassification of Indo-Aryan is largely upheld, and there is a clearly discernible areal east\textendash west divide cutting across language families.},

  abstract = {The literature on the electrophysiology of language comprehension has recently seen a very prominent discussion of ``semantic P600'' effects, which have been observed, for example, in sentences involving an implausible thematic role assignment to an argument that would be a highly plausible filler for a different thematic role of the same verb. These findings have sparked a discussion about underlying properties of the language comprehension architecture, as they have generally been viewed as a challenge to established models of language processing and specifically to the notion that syntax precedes semantics in the comprehension process. In this paper, we review the literature on semantic P600 effects and discuss a number of challenges \textendash{} both conceptual and empirical \textendash{} to existing approaches in this domain. We then provide a new perspective on these effects by showing how they can be derived within an independently motivated, hierarchically organised neurocognitive model of language comprehension in which syntactic structuring precedes argument interpretation (the extended Argument Dependency Model, eADM; Bornkessel and Schlesewsky, 2006). In addition to straightforwardly deriving the phenomenon of a ``semantic P600,'' the basic architectural properties of the eADM account for existing empirical puzzles within the semantic P600 literature.},

  abstract = {Real-time language comprehension is a principal cognitive ability and thereby relates to central properties of the human cognitive architecture. Yet how do the presumably universal cognitive and neural substrates of language processing relate to the astounding diversity of human languages (over 5,000)? The authors present a neurocognitive model of online comprehension, the extended argument dependency model (eADM), that accounts for cross-linguistic unity and diversity in the processing of core constituents (verbs and arguments). The eADM postulates that core constituent processing proceeds in three hierarchically organized phases: (1) constituent structure building without relational interpretation, (2) argument role assignment via a restricted set of cross-linguistically motivated information types (e.g., case, animacy), and (3) completion of argument interpretation using information from further domains (e.g., discourse context, plausibility). This basic architecture is assumed to be universal, with crosslinguistic variation deriving primarily from the information types applied in Phase 2 of comprehension. This conception can derive the appearance of similar neurophysiological and neuroanatomical processing correlates in seemingly disparate structures in different languages and, conversely, of cross-linguistic differences in the processing of similar sentence structures.},

Deictic motion events in Hakhun are encoded by a set of two motion verbs, their serial or versatile verb counterparts, and a set of two ventive particles. Impersonal deictic motion events are encoded by the motion verbs alone, which orient the motion with reference to a center of interest. Motion events with an SAP figure or ground are simultaneously encoded by the motion verbs and ventive particles. These motion events evoke two frames of reference: a home base and the speech-act location. The motion verbs anchor the motion with reference to the home base of the figure, and the ventives (or their absence) anchor the motion with reference to the location of the speaker, the addressee, or the speech-act. When the motion verbs are concatenated with other verbs, they specify motion associated with the action denoted by the other verb(s).},

In particular, the paper asks whether the abstract domain of time gets its relational structure from the more concrete domain of space. Relational similarities between space and time are outlined along with several explanations of how these similarities may have arisen. Three experiments designed to distinguish between these explanations are described. The results indicate that (1) the domains of space and time do share conceptual structure, (2) spatial relational information is just as useful for thinking about time as temporal information, and (3) with frequent use, mappings between space and time come to be stored in the domain of time and so thinking about time does not necessarily require access to spatial schemas. These \textregistered ndings provide some of the \textregistered rst empirical evidence for Metaphoric Structuring. It appears that abstract domains such as time are indeed shaped by metaphorical mappings from more concrete and experiential domains such as space. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The purpose of the current study is to address the use of recorded lectures in an authentic setting by focusing on the actual time spent on the usage of recorded lectures and the impact on lecture attendance and exam performance. The participants were 396 first-year university psychology students attending a mandatory course on biological psychology. During the course, student attendance to face-to-face lectures was registered and the viewing of the recordings monitored. Results revealed that a large amount of students used the recorded lectures as a substitute for lecture attendance. The group who uses recorded lectures as a supplement when developing a knowledge base score significantly higher on the assessment. When assessing higher order thinking skills, no significant differences were found between using recording lectures and attending lectures. This can be partly explained by relatively low predictive value either form of lectures have on exam performance.},

Currently about five people speak the language fluently, but approximately 1,000 people identify as Bardi. The region was settled by Europeans in the 1880s and two missions were founded in Bardi country in the 1890s. Use of the language began declining in the 1930s. Many Bardi people were moved several times between 1940 and 1970, both to other missions dominated by speakers of other Indigenous languages and to local towns such as Derby. This community disruption accelerated the decline of language use in the community and first language acquisition. Bardi is the name of the language variety spoken at One Arm Point. There are two other named mutually intelligible varieties apart from Bardi: Baard and Jawi. The extent of dialect diversity within Bardi is unknown, but does not seem to have been particularly high compared to that between named varieties. The ISO-639 language code is [               bcj               ].},

One of the foci has been the status of complement clauses of complement-taking predicates like               think               . Roughly speaking, the two poles of the issue are the `traditional' assumption according to which the `main clause' is central, and a new `usage-based' picture according to which the `complement clause' is central and the `main clause' is more or less an appendix. From the point of view of an approach that sees structure as having a central role in an overall cognitive-functional picture, this potential polarization is at risk of separating issues that should be kept together. The aim of this paper is to show how a picture that is fully committed to maintaining the role of structural (including structural-semantic) subordination can simultaneously remain fully faithful to principles of usage-based linguistics. Ontogeny and phylogeny (acquisition and diachrony) are central elements in the picture.},

  abstract = {In conversation, turns follow each other with minimal gaps. To achieve this, speakers must launch their utterances shortly before the predicted end of the partner's turn. We examined the relative importance of cues to partner utterance content and partner utterance length for launching coordinated speech. In three experiments, Dutch adult participants had to produce prepared utterances (e.g., vier, ``four'') immediately after a recording of a confederate's utterance (zeven, ``seven''). To assess the role of corepresenting content versus attending to speech cues in launching coordinated utterances, we varied whether the participant could see the stimulus being named by the confederate, the confederate prompt's length, and whether within a block of trials, the confederate prompt's length was predictable. We measured how these factors affected the gap between turns and the participants' allocation of visual attention while preparing to speak. Using a machine-learning technique, model selection by k-fold cross-validation, we found that gaps were most strongly predicted by cues from the confederate speech signal, though some benefit was also conferred by seeing the confederate's stimulus. This shows that, at least in a simple laboratory task, speakers rely more on cues in the partner's speech than corepresentation of their utterance content.},

It needs to replace the monopolies connected to the journals with a genuine, functioning and well-regulated market. In this new market, substitutable service providers compete and innovate according to the conditions of the scholarly community, avoiding another vendor lock-in.Therefore, a standards body needs to form under the governance of the scholarly community to allow the development of open scholarly infrastructures servicing the entire research workflow. We propose a redirection of money from the legacy publishers to the new network by funding bodies broadening their minimal infrastructure requirements at recipient institutions to include modern infrastructure components replacing and complementing journal functionalities. Such updated eligibility criteria by funding agencies would help realign the financial incentives for recipient institutions with public and scholarly interest.},

  abstract = {Sentence comprehension involves a host of highly interrelated processes, including syntactic parsing, semantic composition, and pragmatic inferencing. In neuroimaging, a primary paradigm for examining the brain bases of sentence processing has been to compare brain activity elicited by sentences versus unstructured lists of words. These studies commonly find an effect of increased activity for sentences in the anterior temporal lobes (aTL). Together with neuropsychological data, these findings have motivated the hypothesis that the aTL is engaged in sentence level combinatorics. Combinatoric processing during language comprehension, however, occurs within tens and hundreds of milliseconds, i.e., at a time-scale much faster than the temporal resolution of hemodynamic measures. Here, we examined the time-course of sentence-level processing using magnetoencephalography (MEG) to better understand the temporal profile of activation in this common paradigm and to test a key prediction of the combinatoric hypothesis: because sentences are interpreted incrementally, word-by-word, activity associated with basic linguistic combinatorics should be time-locked to word-presentation. Our results reveal increased anterior temporal activity for sentences compared to word lists beginning approximately 250 ms after word onset. We also observed increased activation in a network of other brain areas, extending across posterior temporal, inferior frontal, and ventral medial areas. These findings confirm a key prediction of the combinatoric hypothesis for the aTL and further elucidate the spatio-temporal characteristics of sentence-level computations in the brain.},

After a short introduction discussing the understanding of the term ``transcription'', the article first focuses on transcription systems in modern gesture research and discusses systems from the field of gestures research, nonverbal communication, conversation analysis, and artificial agents (e.g., Birdwhistell 1970; Sager 2001; Martell 2002; Bressem this volume; Gut et al. 2002; Kipp, Neff, and Albrecht 2007; Lausberg and Sloetjes 2009; HIAT 1, GAT). Afterwards, the paper presents well-known transcription systems for speech from the field of linguistics, conversation, and discourse analysis (e.g., IPA, HIAT, CHAT, DT, GAT). Apart from systems for describing speech, the article also focuses on systems for the transcription of prosody. In doing so, the paper discusses prosodic descriptions within the field of conversation analysis, discourse analysis, and linguistics (HIAT2, GAT2, TSM, ToBI, PROLAB, INTSINT, SAMPROSA). The last sections of the paper focus on the transcription of body posture and gaze (e.g., Birdwhistell 1970; Ehlich and Rehbein 1982; Goodwin 1981; Scho\textasciidieresis{} ps in preparation; Wallbott 1998).},

This paper also investigates the role of complex verbs in a typology of clause-linkage and assesses the syntactic, semantic and discourse differences between one-clause and multiclause strategies: i.e. between complex verbs and syndetic or asyndetic coordinate or subordinate VPs and clauses. It also assesses the semantic notions which are conceptualized as complex predicates rather than as interdependent clauses.},

  abstract = {This article analyses the functions and meanings of the reflexes of the ProtoOceanic (POc) prefix *paRi- in New Caledonian languages and, based on comparisons with other Austronesian languages, seeks to account for their broad polyfunctionality and polysemy in New Caledonia. POc *paRi- originates from Proto-Austronesian and Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *paR-, as evidenced by their reflexes in various Formosan and Malayo-Polynesian languages. In Formosan languages, these prefixes are reciprocal markers and their combination with root reduplication marks plurality of reciprocal participants. In Malayo-Polynesian languages, the prefixes have a greater variety of functions and meanings: they are basically intransitive actor focus morphemes which also express middle voice and reciprocity as well as plural relationship, intensive, and frequentative meanings. In Oceanic languages, the reflexes of POc *paRi- express symmetrical, plural relationship and lower transitivity. POc *paRi- could also combine with two suffixes (POc *-i, *-aki) or with reduplication to express some other meanings (intensive, iterative, distributive, dispersive), as attested in various Oceanic languages. Thus, originally reciprocal prefixes in Formosan languages evolved into more polysemous morphemes in Malayo-Polynesian languages and developed in more or less conservative or innovative ways in Oceanic languages. In the northern New Caledonian languages, the decay of some of their combined suffixes and of reduplication probably triggered the conflation of these various functions and meanings into the preserved and productive prefixes.},

Lexical categories are expressed after roots are derived into morphosyntactic words projected in a syntactic frame; they are then quite rigidly subcategorised as verbal, nominal or adjectival-modifying heads. Still, word forms display some functional flexibility; for instance, nouns and derived nouns, pronouns, numerals may be predicative in equative, ascriptive and focus constructions, simply by being in the syntactic position of the verb. Such functional flexibility is asymmetrical and does not apply to derived verb stems which must be nominalised to achieve argument function.},

This article focuses on the accessibility hierarchy of indefinite expressions to subject and object functions in a sample of Austronesian languages. Aiming at some comparative analysis, some cross-linguistic perspectives on the differential encoding of {$\pm$} definite core arguments and other types of restrictions are discussed. The questions addressed are: (i) What type of indefinite nouns have core argument function? (ii) If barred from core argument function, how are indefinite arguments circumvented? (iii) Does existence or lack of indefinite articles correlate with access to core argument function, and in what way?             In Austronesian languages, one finding is that languages with indefinite articles display fewer restrictions on the access of indefinite NPs to core argument function. Another finding is that differences of definiteness, individuation and specificity of arguments tend to be expressed by distinct domains: the noun phrase in languages with indefinite articles, the verb phrase in languages without indefinite articles (via valency, voice alternations, alignment changes), with an intermediate situation in some Micronesian languages.},

The strategies are (i) AND conjunction, (ii) comitative WITH conjunction, and (iii) inclusorymeronymic constructions, analyzed as a subtype of NP conjunctive strategy. Most languages of the sample appear to be mixed AND and WITH languages in two senses: (i) their WITH conjunctive strategy is also used as an AND strategy (Stassen 2003), or (ii) they use both AND and WITH conjunctive strategies with two distinct morphemes (as in some Formosan languages). The analysis seeks to delineate the syntactic constraints, the semantic and pragmatic features at work in the choice of strategies. It will be shown that if ANDconjunction is structurally symmetrical, WITH-conjunction and meronymic constructions are more asymmetrical, both structurally and in terms of pragmatic saliency. For languages using distinct AND and WITH strategies and morphemes, the distribution of WITH conjunctions is more restricted in terms of conjoined categories, and carry different semantic features.},

  abstract = {Text-to-speech has long been centered on the production of an intelligible message of good quality. More recently, interest has shifted to the generation of more natural and expressive speech. A major issue of existing approaches is that they usually rely on a manual annotation in expressive styles, which tends to be rather subjective. A typical related issue is that the annotation is strongly influenced \textendash{} and possibly biased \textendash{} by the semantic content of the text (e.g. a shot or a fault may incite the annotator to tag that sequence as expressing a high degree of excitation, independently of its acoustic realization). This paper investigates the assumption that human annotation of basketball commentaries in excitation levels can be automatically improved on the basis of acoustic features. It presents two techniques for label correction exploiting a Gaussian mixture and a proportional-odds logistic regression. The automatically re-annotated corpus is then used to train HMM-based expressive speech synthesizers, the performance of which is assessed through subjective evaluations. The results indicate that the automatic correction of the annotation with Gaussian mixture helps to synthesize more contrasted excitation levels, while preserving naturalness.},

Do languages with larger speaker populations change faster due to a greater capacity for innovation, or do smaller populations change faster due to more efficient diffusion of innovations? Do smaller populations suffer greater loss of language elements through founder effects or drift, or do languages with more speakers lose features due to a process of simplification? Revealing the influence of population size on the tempo and mode of language evolution not only will clarify underlying mechanisms of language change but also has practical implications for the way that language data are used to reconstruct the history of human cultures. Here, we provide, to our knowledge, the first empirical, statistically robust test of the influence of population size on rates of language evolution, controlling for the evolutionary history of the populations and formally comparing the fit of different models of language evolution. We compare rates of gain and loss of cognate words for basic vocabulary in Polynesian languages, an ideal test case with a well-defined history. We demonstrate that larger populations have higher rates of gain of new words whereas smaller populations have higher rates of word loss. These results show that demographic factors can influence rates of language evolution and that rates of gain and loss are affected differently. These findings are strikingly consistent with general predictions of evolutionary models.},

The values of these variable properties cannot be assumed but must be empirically determined for individual items and languages. Our characterization can serve as a guide for research, examination of the relationship between evidentiality and other categories, and typological work on evidentials.},

  abstract = {Prosodic categories, like other grammatical categories, are realized with wide variability, yet listeners interpret linguistic meaning with apparent ease. ToBI aims to capture the linguistically meaningful prosodic elements of utterances, but does not capture the variability in acoustic cues that the labeller (and listener) must interpret in order to assign distinctive categories. Despite a long history of empirical work demonstrating the importance of individual cues in signalling prosodic events, little previous work has explored how these cues might systematically combine, trade off and vary in magnitude across ToBI categories. Following recent proposals of cue-based annotation of segments, and disfluent and stuttered speech prosody, the current paper assesses the role of six timing, pitch, and voice quality cues in signalling boundary events in a corpus of independently ToBI-labelled fluent American English speech. Results demonstrate that each cue accounts for unique variance in break index level, and that break index levels increase with the number of cues present per token. The data further suggest that labeller uncertainty is more frequent for tokens that exhibit only a subset of the cues. Future work will investigate annotation of cues to prominence, as well as additional cues to boundaries and grouping.},

  abstract = {There is no consensus on the nature, or even the existence, of Vietnamese word stress. While some authors have proposed that it is morphosyntactically conditioned (Thompson 1963, Thompson 1965, Cao 2003 [1978], Ng\^o 1984), others have adopted the view that it is consistently word-final (Tra\^\`n 1967; Nguye\^\~n \& Ingram 2006, 2007b; Ph\d{a}m 2008; Nguye\^\~n 2010) or that it lacks stress altogether (Emeneau 1951). This is due to the elusive nature of word prominence in Vietnamese, and to the small number of studies that tackle the issue experimentally. In this paper, acoustic experiments designed to test previous hypotheses and tease apart possible types of prominence are presented. Southern Vietnamese disyllabic words with various morphosyntactic structures were recorded in controlled environments to test for stress and phrasal effects. Their duration, mean intensity, mean f0, f0 range and formants were then measured to assess word prominence. Results suggest that there is little evidence for word stress in Southern Vietnamese and that reports of final stress can be reinterpreted as phrase-final lengthening. Focus-marking strategies bring no additional evidence for the existence of stress, but they seem to be partly speaker- and tone-specific, which supports results obtained in studies of Northern Vietnamese (Michaud 2005).},

  abstract = {Mainland Southeast Asia is often viewed as a linguistic area where five different language phyla \textendash{} Austroasiatic, Austronesian, Hmong-Mien, Sino-Tibetan and Kra-Dai \textendash{} have converged typologically. This chapter illustrates areal features found in their prosodic systems, but also emphasizes their oft-understated diversity. The first part of the chapter describes word level prosodic properties. A typology of word shapes and stress is first established: we revisit the concept of monosyllabicity, go over the notion of sesquisyllabicity (as typified by languages like Mon or Burmese) and discuss the realization of alternating stress in languages with polysyllabic words (such as Thai and Khmer). Special attention is then paid to tonation. Although many well-known languages of the area have sizeable inventories of complex tone contours, languages with few or no tones are common (20\% being atonal). Importantly, the phonetic realization of tone frequently involves more than simply pitch: properties like phonation and duration often play a role in signaling tonal contrasts, along with less expected properties like onset voicing and vowel quality. We also show that complex tone alternations (spreading, neutralization and sandhi processes), although not typical, are wellattested. The second part of the chapter addresses the less well-understood topic of phrasal prosody: prosodic phrasing and intonation. We reconsider the question of the amount of conventionalized intonation in languages with complex tone paradigms and pervasive final particles. We also show that information structure is often conveyed by means of overt markers and syntactic restructuring, but that it can also be marked by means of intonational strategies.},

We show that in addition to a large number of atonal languages, the tone languages of the region are actually far more diverse than usually assumed, and employ phonation type contrasts at least as often as pitch. Along the same lines, we argue that concepts such as tone and register, while descriptively useful, can obscure important underlying similarities and impede our understanding of the behavior of phonetic properties, typological regularities, and diachrony.

  abstract = {The Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method of Saitou and Nei (1987) is arguably the most widely used distance-based method for phylogenetic analysis. The NJ algorithm takes an arbitrary distance matrix and, using an agglomerative process, constructs a fully resolved (bifurcating) phylogenetic tree. Dozens of simulation studies and thousands of phylogenetic analyses have demonstrated that NJ is both fast and quite accurate. This success has in turn inspired many variations on the theme, including BioNJ and UNJ (Gascuel 1997a, 1997b), Weighbor-Joining (Bruno, Socci, and Halpern 2000), and NJML (Ota and Li 2000). In this article we describe a new variant of NJ, one which constructs phylogenetic networks instead of phylogenetic trees. Phylogenetic networks generalize phylogenetic trees because they permit the representation of conflicting signal or alternative phylogenetic histories (Fitch 1997). The use of networks, rather than simple branching trees, is clearly necessary when the underlying evolutionary history is not treelike. Recombination, hybridization, gene conversion, and gene transfer all lead to histories that are not adequately modelled by a single tree. Even when the underlying history is treelike, parallel evolution, model heterogeneity, and sampling error may make it difficult to determine a unique tree. In these cases networks can provide a valuable tool for representing ambiguity or for visualizing a space of feasible trees. There are a number of phylogenetic network methods already in use\textemdash Posada and Crandall (2001) provide a comprehensive review. The methods divide roughly into two classes. The first class includes methods that construct networks directly from character data, typically under a parsimony framework. The nodes in the network represent taxa (for example, different haplotypes), hypothetical ancestral taxa, or intermediary nodes. The bestknown network methods in this class are statistical parsimony (Templeton, Crandall, and Sing 1992), median networks (Bandelt et al. 1995), the variants of median networks (Bandelt, Forster, and Ro\textasciidieresis hl 1999; Huber et al.},

  abstract = {Some languages around the Pacific have multiple possessive classes of alienable constructions using appositive nouns or classifiers. This pattern differs from the most common kind of alienable/inalienable distinction, which involves marking, usually affixal, on the possessum, and has only one class of alienables. The Japanese language isolate Ainu has possessive marking that is reminiscent of the Circum-Pacific pattern. It is distinctive, however, in that the possessor is coded not as a dependent in an NP but as an argument in a finite clause, and the appositive word is a verb. This paper gives a first comprehensive, typologically grounded description of Ainu possession and reconstructs the pattern that must have been standard when Ainu was still the daily language of a large speech community; Ainu then had multiple alienable class constructions. We report a cross-linguistic survey expanding previous coverage of the appositive type and show how Ainu fits in. We split alienable/inalienable into two different phenomena: argument structure (with types based on possessibility: optionally possessible, obligatorily possessed, and non-possessible) and valence (alienable, inalienable classes). Valence-changing operations are derived alienability and derived inalienability. Our survey classifies the possessive systems of languages in these terms.},

Residents of the area refer to themselves as the Kaser people, even though they speak several different languages and dialects. The goals of this survey were to determine language and dialect boundaries, evaluate language vitality, and locate the Joso and Juko languages, which are mentioned in the Ethnologue but not documented. The results of the survey indicate that there are three distinct languages within the Kaser area: Ikobi, Mouwase and Barikewa. The Ikobi language includes three different dialects: Upper Turama Kaser, Upper Kikori Kaser and Dukemi. Ethnolinguistic vitality is currently high in all three language areas, as people of all ages primarily use their own local language and have a positive attitude towards their language. Finally, Joso is actually a clan name used by Barikewa speakers in Omati village, and Juko is a clan name used by Ikobi speakers.},

Linguistic research so far lacks both empirical and theoretical work that provides detailed information on the occurrence of intra-individual variation, the reasons for its occurrence and its consequences for language development as well as for language variation and change. The current issue brings together two subdisciplines \textendash{} psycholinguistics and variationist sociolinguistics \textendash{} in juxtaposing systematic and nonsystematic intra-individual variation, thereby attempting to build a cross-fertilisation relationship between two disciplines that have had surprisingly little connection so far. In so doing, we address critical stock-taking, meaningful theorizing and methodological innovation.},

English-speaking and Greek-speaking adults, 3-year-olds, and 4-year-olds viewed and described causative events, which are composed of Means and Result subevents, in an eye tracking study. The results demonstrate cross-linguistic and developmental differences in the informational content of causative event descriptions. Across age groups, Greek speakers were more likely than English speakers to mention only one causative subevent, and across language groups, adults were more likely than children to mention both subevents. Finally, for speakers in all age and language groups, preparing different types of event descriptions changed the way that events were visually inspected, shifting attention towards to-be-encoded subevents. These findings offer some of the first evidence about the development of the language production system, the attentional mechanisms that it employs, and its workings in speakers of different languages.},

  abstract = {Human cooperation is often claimed to be special and requiring explanations based on gene\textendash culture coevolution favouring a desire to copy common social behaviours. If this is true, then individuals should be motivated to both observe and copy common social behaviours. Previous economic experiments, using the public goods game, have suggested individuals' desire to sacrifice for the common good and to copy common social behaviours. However, previous experiments have often not shown examples of success. Here we test, on 489 participants, whether individuals are more motivated to learn about, and more likely to copy, either common or successful behaviours. Using the same social dilemma and standard instructions, we find that individuals were primarily motivated to learn from successful rather than common behaviours. Consequently, social learning disfavoured costly cooperation, even when individuals could observe a stable, pro-social level of cooperation. Our results call into question explanations for human cooperation based on cultural evolution and/or a desire to conform with common social behaviours. Instead, our results indicate that participants were motivated by personal gain, but initially confused, despite receiving standard instructions. When individuals could learn from success, they learned to cooperate less, suggesting that human cooperation is maybe not so special after all.},

  abstract = {The treatment of case has been one of the central concerns within lexical-functional grammar (LFG) since its inception in the late 1970s. LFG separates facts about linear word order and constituency from the functional dependency structure analysis of a clause. A sophisticated analysis of cross-linguistic case patterns only became available as LFG's linking theory (known as lexical mapping theory) evolved. In particular, once it was recognised on the basis of argumentation by Rappaport (1983) that argument structure needed to be posited as a level of representation that was independent of constituent structure, the way was paved for analyses of case to be stated in terms of generalisations over a(rgument)-structure. That is, in terms of generalisations that take both semantic and syntactic factors into account. This article first presents some LFG basics, then briefly charts the development of linking theory and discusses current theories of case. It also considers grammatical relations and grammatical functions, constructive case, and differential case theory. It concludes with a consideration of LFG-based analyses that are couched within optimality theory.},

  abstract = {This study aims to analyze the syntax of serial verbs in the Punjabi language. The serial verb construction (SVC) is a widespread phenomenon across the world languages and in Punjabi as well. The SVC in Punjabi specifically is used as a full event described by two sub-events, with each event described by a separate verb coming together in a sequence. It shows that two different events have their own individuality during overall event. This study is descriptive in nature and a naturalistic methodology is adopted for detailed categorization of SVC in Punjabi. The study shows how the two types of SVCs in Punjabi are completely different from Complex Predicates (CPs) because each SVC contains two VPs but only one V whereas the complex predicate constructions have only one VP but two Vs. The study also shows that the relationship between two verbs/VPs is that of adjunction but not complementation (or coordination). Since this study explores the Indo-Aryan languages which are facing the dearth of linguistic research, it is going to be a useful contribution to the domain of serial verb constructions cross-linguistically. It will also be helpful to draw a line between SVCs and CP formations in the Punjabi language.},

We propose that there is a very tight connection between a light verb and its corresponding main verb, and that this connection differs markedly from the relationship an auxiliary bears to the main verb it is derived from. In particular, we depart from the received view that the existence of a light verb is due to a historical process of semantic bleaching. We instead propose that synchronically there is a single underlying lexical entry which tightly binds light verbs to their corresponding main verb. This proposal accounts not only for the simultaneous synchronic uses of light and main verbs, but also for the historical data.},

However, during the last several decades, numerals proved to be a rich source of debate in linguistics, especially in semantics and pragmatics. The reason is that the study of numerals requires taking into account core issues such as plurality, quantification, implicature/exhaustivity, degree, modality, imprecision and cross-linguistic variation. In this article, we provide a thorough introduction to the issues connected to numeral semantics and pragmatics. We gradually develop analyses of meanings of numerals in natural language using a multitude of analytical tools. We evaluate the competing proposals in terms of empirical coverage and predictions.},

We also tested whether normalization affects discrepancies between recording methods and found that while discrepancies still appear after normalizing with the Watt and Fabricius modified method, Lobanov normalization largely minimizes discrepancies between recording methods. Discrepancies are also mitigated with a Zoom recording setup that involves the speaker wearing headphones and recording with an external microphone.},

In this article we analyze five spectral measures of sibilants (peak, center of gravity, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis) which have been shown to be conditioned by dimensions of identity like speaker gender and sexual orientation in much previous sociolinguistic research. We find that, overall, Zoom recordings yield significantly lower peak, center of gravity, and standard deviation measurements and significantly higher skewness and kurtosis values than in-person recordings for the same speech, likely due to a lower sampling rate on Zoom recordings. However, a preliminary analysis controlling for sampling rate across recording methods reveals the opposite patterns for nearly all measures, suggesting that Zoom stretches the spectral space when compared with the in-person recorder. Because the values of these measurements can lead analysts to draw social interpretations relating to a speaker's performance of gender and sexual identity, we caution against comparing across Zoom and in-person recordings, as differences in measurements may result from the recording method used to collect the data.},

Despite being one of the most widely consumed coffee formats, it is also the most susceptible to variation. We report a novel model, complimented by experiment, that is able to isolate the contributions of several brewing variables, thereby disentangling some of the sources of variation in espresso extraction. Under the key assumption of homogeneous flow through the coffee bed, a monotonic decrease in extraction yield with increasingly coarse grind settings is predicted. However, experimental measurements show a peak in the extraction yield versus grind setting relationship, with lower extraction yields at both very coarse and fine settings. This result strongly suggests that inhomogeneous flow is operative at fine grind settings, resulting in poor reproducibility and wasted raw material. With instruction from our model, we outline a procedure to eliminate these shortcomings.},

The distribution of pauses appears as trimodal, suggesting a categorization in brief ({$<$} 200 ms), medium (200-1000 ms) and long ({$>$} 1000 ms) pauses, the latter occurring only in spontaneous speech. The study reveals possible methodological flaws in previous research in which statistical tests that rely on normality assumption (such as the ANOVA) are routinely applied on non-transformed data, although distributions are far from normal. It also emphasizes the dangerous effect of thresholds, which are very commonly applied in the literature for practical reasons, but can lead to totally false conclusions when comparing speech styles, languages or speakers.},

This is for example the case of a stressed syllable within a word, or of an accented word within an utterance. These prominent units are usually produced with more effort and perceived with more ease, and they often represent a cornerstone for larger and meaningful structures. The notion of linguistic prominence, however, has received a wide number of contradicting or unspecific definitions. In this article, we present an essentialist definition of prominence, which casts it at the crossroads of linguistic signals, meanings and structures, and of the domain-general functions of highlighting and chunking. The papers in this special issue contribute experimental studies on prominence relations, on their role within and across levels of linguistic description, and on how they shape and further our understanding of language.},

  abstract = {In Balti Tibetan, spoken in Baltistan, northern Pakistan, disyllabic non-verbs (nouns, adjectives, and numerals) are stressed on the second syllable (S2). Fundamental frequency is a robust correlate of this S2 stress pattern; vowel duration is a weak and inconsistent cue for stress, while intensity does not play a role. Verbs, in contrast, are stressed on the first syllable (S1); F0, intensity, and vowel duration all contribute to conveying syllable prominence. These findings differ from previous descriptions of Balti in distinguishing stress patterns by lexical category. Further, this is the first work to provide an acoustic characterization of the correlates of stress in Tibetan. As one of the most phonologically conservative varieties of the language, Balti can be considered to preserve the prosodic and acoustic characteristics of Proto-Tibetan. This study thus offers crucial information towards reconstructions of Proto-Tibetan and Proto-Tibeto-Burman, and towards refining hypotheses about Tibetan tonogenesis.},

  abstract = {Crosslinguistically rare sounds may be uncommon as a result of being phonologically marked (Trubetzkoy 1939) or due to articulatory or perceptual biases (Maddieson 1998). Certain types of sound changes are often argued to have roots in articulatory and perceptual biases (Blevins 2004). But in cases where there is limited data available, such as with understudied languages, it may be difficult to find evidence for the roots of sound changes. Synchronic variation can be used to provide evidence for diachronic sound changes (Blevins 2004; Lindblom 1990; Ohala 1993), which is particularly useful when historical data is limited. In this investigation we discuss phonetic biases, including acoustic and perceptual factors, that contribute to a set of sound changes in Tlingit, a critically endangered Indigenous language of Alaska, British Columbia, and the Yukon, that resulted in a primary split-merger (Blust 2012). This investigation provides further support for including explicit discussion of synchronic variation as part of the description of understudied languages. We propose that there should be a stronger emphasis on documenting and analyzing variation within understudied languages because excluding variation potentially masks significant intralinguistic and crosslinguistic phenomena.},

In this conceptual paper, student responses to feedback are reviewed and a number of barriers to student uptake of feedback are discussed. Four inter-related features are proposed as a framework underpinning students'feedback literacy: appreciating feedback; making judgments; managing affect; and taking action. Two well-established learning activities, peer feedback and analysing exemplars, are discussed to illustrate how this framework can be operationalized. Some ways in which these two enabling activities can be re-focused more explicitly towards developing students'feedback literacy are elaborated. Teachers are identified as playing important facilitating roles in promoting student feedback literacy through curriculum design, guidance and coaching. The implications and conclusion summarise recommendations for teaching and set out an agenda for further research.},

The COVID-19 global pandemic and its associated infodemic may change this state of affairs, at least for documentary linguists. Documenting languages may bring researchers in direct contact with communities speaking minority or marginalized languages and gain key insights into their communicative ecologies. By being both immersed in local networks and more or less knowledgeable about the community's communicative habits, documentary linguists appear to be placed in a unique position to contribute to communicating risk in ways that are better tailored to the community and, therefore, potentially quite effective locally. Furthermore, adding work in risk communication to their agenda may also stimulate documentary linguists to find new models for ``giving back'' to the communities they work with. In order to provide a concrete example of how all this may play out in concrete terms, we illustrate the virALLanguages project.},

This paper evaluates the ef cacy of teaching and learning in higher education by investigating the relationship between students assessment of their own academic pro ciency (in this case Research Methods Pro ciency [RMP]), learning style, academic locus of control, academic self-ef cacy and academic achievement. First and second year undergraduate students' RMP was measured before and after completing modules in Research Methods. Students also completed measures of approaches to learning, academic self-ef cacy and academic locus of control. Academic achievement (module mark) was also recorded. Results showed that perceived pro ciency increased after completing the taught modules and that perceived pro ciency was positively correlated with academic performance. Level 1 students, taught under the recently modi ed programme, reported signi cantly higher perceived pro ciency than Level 2 students taught under the previous programme. Perceived pro ciency was positively correlated with a strategic learning approach and negatively correlated with a surface learning approach and external locus of control beliefs. Academic achievement was also positively correlated with a strategic learning approach and negatively correlated with an apathetic learning approach. A deep learning approach failed to be associated with either RMP or academic achievement. It is suggested that: (i) these ndings con rm, to some degree, the suggestion that there is an emphasis in later education on performance rather than learning (Lyddy, 1998); and (ii) perceived pro ciency is a useful evaluation measure and is likely to contribute to effective and productive teaching and learning within higher education.},

While these are often assumed to result from contact with non-Indo-European languages, an alternative possibility is that classifiers developed as a response to the rise of optional plural marking. This alternative is in line with the so-called GreenbergSanches-Slobin (henceforth GSS) generalization. The GSS generalization holds that the presence of sortal numeral classifiers across languages is negatively correlated with obligatory plural marking on nouns. We assess the extent to which Indo-Iranian classifier development is influenced by loosening of restrictions on plural marking using a sample of 65 languages and a Bayesian phylogenetic model, inferring posterior distributions over evolutionary transition rates between typological states and using these rates to reconstruct the history of classifiers and number marking throughout Indo-Iranian, constrained by historically attested states. We find broad support for a diachronically oriented construal of the GSS generalization, but find no evidence for a strong bias against the synchronic co-occurrence of classifiers and obligatory plural marking. Inspection of the most likely diachronic trajectories in individual lineages in the tree shows a stronger effect of the GSS among Iranian languages than Indo-Aryan languages. Taken as a whole, these findings suggest that the association of classifiers and optional number marking in Indo-Iranian is neither solely the effect of universal mechanisms nor of the contingency of local contact histories.},

Using an experimental 9 field work approach, we analysed approximately 4,000 utterances. We demonstrate that the seman- 10 tics of LLI is broadly event-quantificational as well as temporally scalar. LLI imposes aspectual se- 11 lectional restrictions on the verbs it combines with (they must be durative, i.e. cannot describe `punc- 12 tual', atomic events), and requires the event description effected by said verbs to exceed a contextu- 13 ally-determined relative scalar meaning (e.g., a `typical duration' \`a la (Tatevosov 2008)). Iwaidja 14 differs from other Northern Australian languages with similar intonation patterns (see e.g. (Bishop 15 2002: 2002; Simard 2013)), in that it does not seem to have any argument NP-related incremental or 16 event scalar meaning. This suggests that LLI is a decidedly grammatical, language-specific device; 17 not a purely iconic kind of expression (even though it also possibly has an iconic dimension).},

  abstract = {Tipping points in social convention                            Once a population has converged on a consensus, how can a group with a minority viewpoint overturn it? Theoretical models have emphasized tipping points, whereby a sufficiently large minority can change the societal norm. Centola               et al.               devised a system to study this in controlled experiments. Groups of people who had achieved a consensus about the name of a person shown in a picture were individually exposed to a confederate who promoted a different name. The only incentive was to coordinate. When the number of confederates was roughly 25\% of the group, the opinion of the majority could be tipped to that of the minority.                                         Science               , this issue p.               1116                        ,              Committed minorities can overturn established social conventions when a critical size is reached.           ,              Theoretical models of critical mass have shown how minority groups can initiate social change dynamics in the emergence of new social conventions. Here, we study an artificial system of social conventions in which human subjects interact to establish a new coordination equilibrium. The findings provide direct empirical demonstration of the existence of a tipping point in the dynamics of changing social conventions. When minority groups reached the critical mass\textemdash that is, the critical group size for initiating social change\textemdash they were consistently able to overturn the established behavior. The size of the required critical mass is expected to vary based on theoretically identifiable features of a social setting. Our results show that the theoretically predicted dynamics of critical mass do in fact emerge as expected within an empirical system of social coordination.},

The suggestion here is that certain important aspects of this ``covert prosody'' of written language are reflected in punctuation. In order to study systematically the degree to which punctuation reflects the covert prosody of written language, one would like to find independent ways of uncovering that prosody. Two such ways are explored here: reading aloud and ``repunctuating'' (inserting punctuation in passages from which the author's punctuation has been removed). The article focuses especially on the relation between ``punctuation units'' (stretches of language between punctuation marks) and the ``intonation units'' of speech, and the variations in this relation that are found among different authors and different styles. It explores the degree to which different pieces of writing are prosodically spokenlike, and the degree to which they capture the prosodic imagery of ordinary readers. ``Close'' and ``open'' punctuation are discussed, as are selected grammatical sites at which there is a discrepancy between punctuation and prosody. It is suggested that an awareness of prosodic imagery is an important ingredient of ``good writing.''},

In addition, we develop an approach combining Talmy's (1985) motion events with the proform analysis to account for how Figure and Ground are represented concurrently with spatial verbs in spatial constructions and how the proforms of Figure and Ground are formed to satisfy such requirement. It is shown that in Taiwan Sign Language the proforms of Ground are more predictable than those of Figure, because the Ground usually takes the handshape of the non-moving hand as its proform, while the Figure usually adopts a new handshape that is not part of the given sign to serve as its proform.},

We chart the relevant phenomena, and we provide a typological survey of optional and alternating marking for A and O arguments. We also highlight some of the questions that remain, including problems with the classic model of case marking based on markedness reversal. A final section investigates the diachronic origins of optional case markers. These are largely similar to those for nonoptional systems, apart from certain source domains, as well as factors related to information structure, both in the form of source domains and as constructional contexts playing a role in the development of the markers.},

  abstract = {Is it possible to define a coefficient of correlation which is (a) as simple as the classical coefficients like Pearson's correlation or Spearman's correlation, and yet (b) consistently estimates some simple and interpretable measure of the degree of dependence between the variables, which is 0 if and only if the variables are independent and 1 if and only if one is a measurable function of the other, and (c) has a simple asymptotic theory under the hypothesis of independence, like the classical coefficients? This article answers this question in the affirmative, by producing such a coefficient. No assumptions are needed on the distributions of the variables. There are several coefficients in the literature that converge to 0 if and only if the variables are independent, but none that satisfy any of the other properties mentioned above.},

While the Leipzig Glossing Rules (LGR) provide general standards and principles for IGT, we argue here that language-family specific guidelines are necessary to facilitate rapid creation of new interpretable IGT that can be used for language description, typological discovery, and cross-language comparison. Using selected examples of Tibeto-Burman IGTs, we demonstrate how linguists create their own terminology and conventions for representing linguistic phenomena which fall outside the scope of the LGR. To date, there are few, at least within the Sino-Tibetan linguistics community, that have discussed language-family specific IGT conventions, so new annotators lack guidance on IGT creation. This paper examines how typical Tibeto-Burman constructions (e.g., reduplication, verb stem alternation, directionals) are represented in IGT from several South Central Tibeto-Burman languages. We offer some remarks on the purposes of IGT and some principles for new IGT creators.},

Its goal is to give advice to fieldworkers from this particular point of view, and to draw their attention to methodological issues with respect to the completeness of data collection during fieldwork and the veracity of the interpretations and analyses subsequent researchers are able to undertake without visiting the field. The same holds for more recent books on a similar subject. One must distinguish a mathematical concept and its application. From an ethnomathematical point of view it is useful to make a few observations on the best way to record annotated new media while visiting the field, whether video or computer experiment, in order to make possible afterwards the exploration of their mathematical content. The study devoted to the question of completeness of data collection during fieldwork, a crucial point in ethnomathematics for checking the consistency of mathematical knowledge embedded in the data. The study tackles the question of vernacular lexicons used for numbers and measurement, and it will be seen that it only partly meet the general goals of an ethnomathematical approach. Furthermore, the article discusses the use of measurement terms. Finally, it addresses the question of mathematical operations on approximate quantities carried out in a society where there are no number words above five.},

Thus, incommensurability can occur in conceptual change across different ontological categories. I use a historical case to illustrate how the ontological difference between an object and an event concept actually caused incommensurability in the context of nineteenth-century optics.

Based on iconicity, compound verbs can be said to be the best candidates for encoding conceptually integrated complex events considering their high lexical integrity. This paper shows that the two types of macro-events in compound verbs are distinct in the order of the framing event and the co-event, the representation of the framing event, and their lexical integrity. These results suggest that the differences in baseline/elaboration organization iconically emerge as explicit differences in linguistic forms, indicating the validity of the ``iconicity of structured mapping in compounds''.},

Malayo-Polynesian is currently 					considered a primary branch of Austronesian, with no identifiably closer relationship with any linguistic subgroup in the homeland 						(               Blust 1999               ,               2009/2013               ;               Ross 2005               ).

This observation points to a revised subgrouping more consistent with a socio-historical picture where the out-of-Taiwan 					population descended from a seafaring community expanding to the Batanes and Luzon after having developed a seafaring tradition. 					It also aligns with recent findings in archaeology and genetics that (i) eastern Taiwan is the most likely starting point of 					Austronesian dispersal (               Hung 2005               ,               2008               ,               2019               ;               Bellwood 2017               ;               Bellwood \& Dizon 						2008               ;               Carson \& Hung 2018               ) and (ii) that the Amis bear a significantly 					closer relationship with Austronesian communities outside Taiwan (               Capelli et~al. 2001               ;               Trejaut et~al. 2005               ;               McColl et~al. 2018               ;               Pugach et~al. 2021               ;               T\"atte et~al. 2021               ).

  abstract = {Though the term NATIVE SPEAKER/SIGNER is frequently used in language research, it is inconsistently conceptualized. Factors such as age, order, and context of acquisition, in addition to social/cultural identity, are often differentially conflated. While the ambiguity and harmful consequences of the term NATIVE SPEAKER have been problematized across disciplines, much of this literature attempts to repurpose the term in order to include and/or exclude certain populations. This paper problematizes NATIVE SPEAKER within psycholinguistics, arguing that the term is both unhelpful to rigorous theory construction and harmful to marginalized populations by reproducing normative assumptions about behavior, experience, and identity. We propose that language researchers avoid NATIVE SPEAKER altogether, and we suggest alternate ways of characterizing language experience/use.The vagueness of NATIVE SPEAKER can create problems in research design (e.g., through systematically excluding certain populations), recruitment (as participants' definitions might diverge from researchers'), and analysis (by distilling continuous factors into under-specified binary categories). This can result in barriers to cross-study comparison, which is particularly concerning for theory construction and replicability. From a research ethics perspective, it matters how participants are characterized and included: Excluding participants based on binary/essentialist conceptualizations of nativeness upholds deficit perspectives towards multilingualism and non-hegemonic modes of language acquisition. Finally, by implicitly assuming the existence of a critical period, NATIVE SPEAKER brings with it theoretical baggage which not all researchers may want to carry.Given the issues above and how `nativeness' is racialized (particularly in European and North American contexts), we ask that researchers consider carefully whether exclusion of marginalized/minoritized populations is necessary or justified\textemdash particularly when NATIVE SPEAKER is used only as a way to achieve linguistic homogeneity. Instead, we urge psycholinguists to explicitly state the specific axes traditionally implied by NATIVENESS that they wish to target. We outline several of these (e.g., order of acquisition, allegiance, comfort with providing intuitions), and give examples of how to recruit and describe participants while eschewing NATIVE SPEAKER. Shifting away from harmful conventions such as NATIVE SPEAKER will not only improve research design and analysis, but is also one way we can co-create a more just and inclusive field.},

Initial and final f0 heights were defined as the f0 values extracted at the energy max of the first and the last syllable of the PU. The semantic structure of the PU was defined based on its co-extensiveness with a semantic unit in discourse (DU), i.e., a proposition, often encoded by a clause. Our analysis shows significant relationships between the cross-boundary f0 heights and the PU-DU co-extensiveness. PU-DU left alignment introduces a significant up-shifting effect on both initial and final f0 heights. This pitch resetting is effective across the whole PU, suggesting speakers' sensitivity to the initiation of propositions in production. On the other hand, PU-DU right alignment introduces a down-shifting effect on both f0 heights. The regressive f0-lowering observed in the PU-initial f0 heights (anticipatory effect based on the PU-terminal semantics) and the progressive f0-raising of the PU-final f0 heights (carried-over effect based on the PU-initial semantics) both shed light on the psycholinguistic importance of the proposition and support its central role in advanced planning in spontaneous speech production.},

Type 1 constructions are attested in many Chinese varieties, such as Mandarin, Min, Wu, Hui, Hakka and Cantonese, whereas Type 2 constructions are more rare and thus far are mainly attested in Southern Min and some Mandarin varieties. Two major pathways in the development of unaccusative `give' constructions are identified in this paper, namely, the causative pathway and the passive-mediated pathway. Our analysis also traces how the unaccusative `give' construction develops into a marker of adversity and speaker affectedness. The findings of this study have implications for understanding the relationship between changes in valence (i.e., the number of core arguments that are profiled in a given construction) and speaker's subjective stance.},

Preliminary results of documentation work cast doubt on the validity of Qiangic as a genetic unit, and suggest instead that features presently seen as probative of the membership in this subgroup are rather the result of diffusion across genetic boundaries. I furthermore argue that the four local languages currently labeled Qiangic are highly distinct and not likely to be closely genetically related. Subsequently, I discuss Qiangic as an areal grouping in terms of its defining characteristics, as well as possible hypotheses pertaining to the genetic affiliation of its member languages currently labeled Qiangic. I conclude with some reflections on the issue of subgrouping in the Qiangic context and in Sino-Tibetan at large.},

These three types of constructions are demonstrated to show strong resemblance in their formal make-up, sharing basic structure (in which the standard NP is constructed as an adverbial phrase) and one standard marker (/p{$\Elztrna$}/). The goals of the paper are (1) to provide a detailed synchronic description of the three types of constructions, and (2) to place their distinctive characteristics within a larger typological context. Given that Lizu comparative constructions belong to the Particle Comparative type, which is argued to be an areal phenomenon in the regions where it is attested (Stassen 1985, 2013; Heine 1997), Lizu comparative constructions (but also equative and similative constructions) are examined in the local areal context, and compared to corresponding constructions in the linguistic neighbors of Lizu: Tibetan, Pumi, Namuzi, Nuosu, and Mandarin. It is argued that Lizu's comparative constructions are unique among its linguistic neighbors. The implications of the findings are discussed in typological, areal, and diachronic perspective.},

The intricate relationship between phonetics and prosodic structure has been explored in the literature under the rubric of the phonetics\textendash prosody interface. This paper reviews various aspects of the phonetics\textendash prosody interface and discusses how prosodic structure modulates phonetic realization within and across languages. A particular attention is paid to boundary-related prosodic strengthening (i.e., spatial and/or temporal expansion of articulation that arises in the vicinity of prosodic junctures), especially in association with domain-initial positions (also known as domain-initial strengthening, DIS, effects). Prosodic boundary strengthening is further discussed in terms of how it is language-specifically fine-tuned, how it is understood in dynamical terms, and how it relates to linguistic functions (as syntagmatic vs. paradigmatic contrast enhancement) that are all further conditioned by other factors of the linguistic sound system of individual languages such as the prominence system and the phonetic feature system.},

  abstract = {In this special collection entitled Marking 50 Years of Research on Voice Onset Time and the Voicing Contrast in the World's Languages, we have compiled eleven studies investigating the voicing contrast in 19 languages. The collection provides extensive data obtained from 270 speakers across those languages, examining VOT and other acoustic, aerodynamic and articulatory measures. The languages studied may be divided into four groups: `aspirating' languages with a two-way contrast (English, three varieties of German); `true voicing' languages with a two-way contrast (Russian, Turkish, Brazilian Portuguese, two Iranian languages Pashto and Wakhi); languages with a three-way contrast (Thai, Vietnamese, Khmer, Yerevan Armenia, three Indo-Aryan languages, Dawoodi, Punjabi and Shina, and Burushaki); and Indo-Aryan languages with a more than three-way contrast (Jangli and Urdu with a four-way contrast, and Sindhi and Siraiki with a five-way contrast). We discuss the cross-linguistic data, focusing on how much VOT alone tells us about the voicing contrast in these languages, and what other phonetic dimensions (such as consonant-induced F0 and voice quality) are needed for a complete understanding of laryngeal contrast in these languages. Implications for various issues emerge: universal phonetic feature systems, effects of language contact on linguistic levelling, and the relation between laryngeal contrast and supralaryngeal articulation. The cross-linguistic VOT data also lead us to discuss how the distribution of VOT as measured acoustically may allow us to infer the underlying articulation and how it might be approached in gestural phonologies. The discussion on these multiple issues sparks new questions to be resolved, and provide indications of where the field may be best directed in exploring laryngeal contrast in voicing in the world's languages.},

  abstract = {Memory is fleeting. New material rapidly obliterates previous material. How, then, can the brain deal successfully with the continual deluge of linguistic input? We argue that, to deal with this ``Now-or-Never'' bottleneck, the brain must compress and recode linguistic input as rapidly as possible. This observation has strong implications for the nature of language processing: (1) the language system must ``eagerly'' recode and compress linguistic input; (2) as the bottleneck recurs at each new representational level, the language system must build a multilevel linguistic representation; and (3) the language system must deploy all available information predictively to ensure that local linguistic ambiguities are dealt with ``Right-First-Time''; once the original input is lost, there is no way for the language system to recover. This is ``Chunk-and-Pass'' processing. Similarly, language learning must also occur in the here and now, which implies that language acquisition is learning to process, rather than inducing, a grammar. Moreover, this perspective provides a cognitive foundation for grammaticalization and other aspects of language change. Chunk-and-Pass processing also helps explain a variety of core properties of language, including its multilevel representational structure and duality of patterning. This approach promises to create a direct relationship between psycholinguistics and linguistic theory. More generally, we outline a framework within which to integrate often disconnected inquiries into language processing, language acquisition, and language change and evolution.},

An important advantage of the canonical approach is that it provides an instrument to investigate periphrastic realisations in finer detail, and takes periphrasis as an integral part of the morphological and syntactic systems of an individual language.},

  abstract = {Many years of linguistic research have led to no consensus on the issue of whether every language has nouns, verbs, and adjectives. This article investigates the issue from the perspective of Chamorro, an Austronesian language of the Mariana Islands. Chamorro has been claimed to have an unusual lexical category system consisting of just two language-particular categories. Evidence is presented here that (i) the language does in fact have nouns, verbs, and adjectives, and (ii) the apparent use of content words in multiple syntactic functions results from productive processes of denominal verb formation and denominal adjective formation that are not signaled by overt morphology. The lexical semantics and pragmatics of these processes are shown to be broadly parallel to d\-enominal verb formation in English. Overall, the evidence supports the claim that lexical categories are universal, and suggests that the broad routes by which semantic and phonological material can be packaged into lexical categories may be universal as well.},

The effects of syntax on phonology are mediated by prosodic structure, a representation of prosodic constituents calculated from syntactic structure but not isomorphic to it. Within this overall architecture, I investigate the placement of weak pronouns in the Austronesian language Chamorro. Certain Chamorro pronominals can be realized as prosodically deficient weak pronouns that typically occur right after the predicate. I show that these pronouns are second-position clitics whose placement is determined not syntactically, but prosodically: they occur after the leftmost phonological phrase of their intonational phrase. My analysis of these clitics assumes that lexical insertion is late and can affect and be affected by prosodic phrase formation\textemdash assumptions consistent with the view that the mutual interaction of phonology and syntax is confined to the postsyntactic operations that translate syntactic structure into prosodic structure.},

Findings reveal (1) children improve their pitch discrimination and prosodic awareness from preschool to fourth grade; (2) pitch interval discrimination (frequency separation between tones) contributes to receptive vocabulary whereas pitch contour discrimination (patterns of rising and falling pitch) predicts word reading; (3) phonological awareness accounts for more variability in receptive vocabulary than prosodic awareness; whereas the reverse was found for word reading and reading comprehension. Together, prosody and its acoustic cue (i.e., pitch) play a vital role in learning to read Mandarin.},

It shows that an adequate description of the Korean SVCs needs to sub-classify them into several in accordance with their own constructional constraints. In particular, the paper proposes the first verb in the SVC is an adjunct with the modifier feature inherited from the head-adjunct structure, whereas the second, final verb V2 is the morpho-syntactic and aspectual head. In addition, the paper sketches how the formal properties of the SVCs, including the similarities and differences between the SVCs and other similar V-V complex constructions, can follow from the inheritance type hierarchy with the notion of constructions.},

However, since nations are connected in various ways, such as via spatial proximity and shared cultural ancestry, cross-national analyses often violate assumptions of non-independence, inflating false positive rates. Here, we show that, despite being recognised as an important statistical pitfall for over 200 years, cross-national research in economics and psychology still does not sufficiently account for non-independence. In a review of the 100 highest-cited cross-national studies of economic development and values, we find that controls for non-independence are rare. When studies do include controls for non-independence, our simulations suggest that commonly used methods continue to produce false positives. In reanalyses of twelve cross-national relationships, we show that half are no longer significant after controlling for non-independence using global proximity matrices. We urge social scientists to sufficiently control for non-independence in cross-national research.},

Speakers can use these announcements in turn to implicate, for example, that they are searching for a word, are deciding what to say next, want to keep the floor, or want to cede the floor. Evidence for the proposal comes from several large corpora of spontaneous speech. The evidence shows that speakers monitor their speech plans for upcoming delays worthy of comment. When they discover such a delay, they formulate where and how to suspend speaking, which item to produce (uh or um), whether to attach it as a clitic onto the previous word (as in ``and-uh''), and whether to prolong it. The argument is that uh and um are conventional English words, and speakers plan for, formulate, and produce them just as they would any word. q 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

This paper explains the VOS order of Niuean pseudo noun incorporation by appealing to a condition on prosodic well-formedness, ARGUMENT-{$\varphi$}, that requires a head and its internal argument(s) to form a unique phonological phrase. In order to satisfy this requirement, the incorporated argument undergoes prosodic restructuring into a position adjacent to the verb at PF. Since the verb arrives at its clause-initial position via X0 raising, the syntactic input to the prosodic grammar is VSO, while the prosodic output is VOS.},

In a right-branching language like English, the presence of a large prosodic boundary might signal the end of the current constituent, requiring the following constituent to be attached high in the syntactic tree. We present three listening experiments that test an alternative position suggested in Carlson, Clifton, and Frazier (2001) as the ``informative boundary'' hypothesis. This hypothesis claims that the interpretation of a prosodic boundary is determined not by its absolute size but by its size relative to relevant certain other boundaries. Experiment 1 confirmed the predictions of this hypothesis in phrases like the old men and women with very large houses, manipulating the boundaries before and and with. Experiment 2 investigated the effect in a variety of diverse syntactic structures, varying syntactic category and status (head vs. nonhead) of the ambiguous constituent. It confirmed the predictions of the informative boundary hypothesis in every structure tested except for `-ly' adverbs that are ambiguous between a manner interpretation and a speaker-evaluation interpretation. Experiment 3 demonstrated that sentence interpretation was affected by the size of the late boundary relative to a relevant early boundary, but not relative to an early boundary that was predicted to be irrelevant.},

In turn, reanalysis mechanisms are initiated when the overall structure of the event is violated and/or does not conform to predictions set up by the context. Event cognition thus emerges from a network of conceptual information links with event-specific selectional restrictions and hierarchical organization. Altogether, this literature suggests that the brain uses overlapping mechanisms of comprehension to rapidly process events in both language and visual events.},

  abstract = {An important aspect of learning to read is efficiency in accessing different kinds of linguistic information (orthographic, phonological, and semantic) about written words. The present study investigates whether, in addition to the integrity of such linguistic skills, early progress in reading may require a degree of cognitive flexibility in order to manage the coordination of this information effectively. Our study will look for evidence of a link between flexibility and both word reading and passage reading comprehension, and examine whether any such link involves domain-general or reading-specific flexibility. As the only previous support for a predictive relationship between flexibility and early reading comes from studies of reading comprehension in the opaque English orthography, another possibility is that this relationship may be largely orthography-dependent, only coming into play when mappings between representations are complex and polyvalent. To investigate these questions, 60 second-graders learning to read the more transparent French orthography were presented with two multiple classification tasks involving reading-specific cognitive flexibility (based on words) and non-specific flexibility (based on pictures). Reading skills were assessed by word reading, pseudo-word decoding, and passage reading comprehension measures. Flexibility was found to contribute significant unique variance to passage reading comprehension even in the less opaque French orthography. More interestingly, the data also show that flexibility is critical in accounting for one of the core components of reading comprehension, namely, the reading of words in isolation. Finally, the results constrain the debate over whether flexibility has to be reading-specific to be critically involved in reading.},

However, to evaluate the success of such interventions, the self-regulatory characteristics of students need to be established. This paper examines the self-regulatory characteristics of a cohort of second-year allied health students, using the evaluation of responses to ``meta-learning'' assessment tasks supported by access data from the learning management system. Students primarily report using learning strategies from the performance and self-reflection phases. Although few reported using forethought strategies, access to preparatory course materials suggests that these were under-reported. Students who reported reviewing lectures as a learning strategy were more likely to access the online lecture recordings; however, higher access was associated with poorer academic performance. Cluster analysis of all available data showed high academic performance was positively associated with early submission of intra-semester assessment tasks but negatively associated with both use of, and reported of use of lecture recordings by students. These findings suggest that early submission of intra-semester assessment may be useful as a predictor of academic achievement.},

A number of possible solutions are examined, in particular a purely formal principle (the Minimal Distance Principle) and a pragmatic principle rooted in Searle's theory of speech acts. It is concluded that any explanatory account of the subject/object control distinction must be grounded in the pragmatics of speech acts, although in at least some languages, including English, these pragmatic principles have become grammaticalized.},

  abstract = {The models of linguistic networks and their analytical tools constitute a potential methodology for investigating the formation of structural patterns in actual language use. Research with this methodology has just started, which can hopefully shed light on the emergent nature of linguistic structure. This study attempts to employ linguistic networks to investigate the formation of modern Chinese two-character words (as structural units based on the chunking of their component characters) in the actual use of modern Chinese, which manifests itself as continuous streams of Chinese characters. Network models were constructed based on authentic Chinese language data, with Chinese characters as nodes, their cooccurrence relations as directed links, and the co-occurrence frequencies as link weights. Quantitative analysis of the network models has shown that a Chinese two-character word can highlight itself as a two-node island, i.e., a cohesive sub-network with its two component characters co-occurring more frequently than they co-occur with the other characters. This highlighting mechanism may play a vital role in the formation and acquisition of two-character words in actual language use. Moreover, this mechanism may also throw some light on the emergence of other structural phenomena (with the chunking of specific linguistic units as their basis).},

There is growing agreement that the lexicon also contains formulaic language (               How are you? kick the bucket               ). In fact, there are compelling reasons to think that the brain represents formulaic sequences in long-term memory, bypassing the need to compose them online through word selection and grammatical sequencing in capacity-limited working memory. The research surveyed in this chapter strongly supports the position that there is an advantage in the way that native speakers process formulaic language compared to nonformulaic language. This advantage extends to the access and use of different types of formulaic language, including idioms, binomials, collocations, and lexical bundles. However, the evidence is mixed for nonnative speakers. While very proficient nonnatives sometimes exhibit processing advantages similar to natives, less proficient learners often have been shown to process formulaic language in a word-by-word manner similar to nonformulaic language. Furthermore, if the formulaic language is idiomatic (where the meaning cannot be understood from the component words), the figurative meanings can be much more difficult to process for nonnatives than nonidiomatic, nonformulaic language.},

But, although this words-and-rules framework has proven itself to be useful in natural language processing and cognitive science, it has also shown important shortcomings when faced with actual language use. In this article, we review evidence from language acquisition, sentence processing, and computational modeling that shows how multiword expressions such as idioms, collocations, and other meaningful and common units that comprise more than one word play a key role in the organization of our linguistic knowledge. Importantly, multiword expressions straddle the line between lexicon and grammar, calling into question how useful this distinction is as a foundation for our understanding of language. Nonetheless, finding a replacement for the foundational role the words-and-rules approach has played in our theories is not straightforward. Thus, the second part of our article reviews and synthesizes the diverse approaches that have attempted to account for the central role of multiword expressions in language representation, acquisition, and processing.},

However, even though multiple alternatives may be acceptable in theory, often one of them will be preferred over the others. The question we explored here was what happens when speakers produce less preferred alternatives. We developed a new experimental paradigm to reliably elicit the propositional or double object dative with varying degrees of preference. We then used this paradigm to investigate how, given properties of the message, an individual speaker's preference for a particular structure affects how that utterance is produced. Speakers gestured more and were more likely to be disfluent when they chose less preferred structures. Thus, having a choice per se does not guarantee more successful production. Instead, production is facilitated when speakers choose more preferred alternatives.},

For example, languages differ greatly in the number of syllables they allow, resulting in large variation in the Shannon information per syllable. Nevertheless, all natural languages allow their speakers to efficiently encode and transmit information. We show here, using quantitative methods on a large cross-linguistic corpus of 17 languages, that the coupling between language-level (information per syllable) and speaker-level (speech rate) properties results in languages encoding similar information rates (\textasciitilde 39 bits/s) despite wide differences in each property individually: Languages are more similar in information rates than in Shannon information or speech rate. These findings highlight the intimate feedback loops between languages' structural properties and their speakers' neurocognition and biology under communicative pressures. Thus, language is the product of a multiscale communicative niche construction process at the intersection of biology, environment, and culture.},

  abstract = {This cross-linguistic study focuses on ways in which conversationalists speak beyond a point of possible turn completion in conversation, specifically on turn extensions which are grammatically dependent, backward-looking and extend the prior action. It argues that further distinctions can be made in terms of whether the extension is prosodically integrated with the prior unit, its host, (               Non-add-on               ) or not, and in terms of whether it repairs some part of the host (               Replacement               ) or not. Added-on, non-repairing extensions are further distinguished in terms of whether they are grammatically fitted to the end of the host (               Glue-ons               ) or not (               Insertables               ). A preliminary survey of TCU continuation in English, German and Japanese conversation reveals a number of significant differences with respect to frequency and range of extension type. English is at one extreme in preferring Glue-ons over Non-Add-ons and Insertables, whereas Japanese is at the other extreme in preferring Non-add-ons and Insertables over Glue-ons. German occupies an intermediary position but is on the whole more like Japanese. The preference for Glue-ons vs. Insertables appears to reflect a language's tendency towards syntactic left- vs. right headedness. In conclusion the study argues for a classification of `increment' types which goes beyond the English-based Glue-on, attributes a central role to prosodic delivery and adopts a usage-based understanding of word order.},

  abstract = {Virtual reality environments presented on tablets and smartphones have potential to aid the early diagnosis of conditions such as Alzheimer's dementia by quantifying impairments in navigation performance. However, it is unclear whether performance on mobile devices can predict navigation errors in the real world. We compared the performance of 49 participants (25 females, 18-35 years old) at wayfinding and path integration tasks designed in our mobile app `Sea Hero Quest' with their performance at similar tasks in a real-world environment. We first performed this experiment in the streets of London (UK) and replicated it in Paris (France). In both cities, we found a significant correlation between virtual and realworld wayfinding performance and a male advantage in both environments, although smaller in the real world (Cohen's d in the game = 0.89, in the real world = 0.59). Results in London and Paris were highly similar, and controlling for familiarity with video games did not change the results. The strength of the correlation between real world and virtual environment increased with the difficulty of the virtual wayfinding task, indicating that Sea Hero Quest does not merely capture video gaming skills. The fact that the Sea Hero Quest wayfinding task has real-world ecological validity constitutes a step toward controllable, sensitive, safe, low-cost, and easy to administer digital cognitive assessment of navigation ability.},

SVCs express a range of grammatical meanings and are attested in numerous spoken languages all around the world. Yet, to date only few studies have investigated the existence and functions of SVCs in sign languages. For the most part, these studies\textemdash including a previous study on Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT)\textemdash relied on elicited data. In this article, we offer a cross-modal typological contribution to the study of SVCs by investigating the phenomenon based on naturalistic corpus data from NGT. A search of the Corpus NGT yielded 41 mono-clausal utterances in which one of a closed set of verbs\textemdash namely GO, GIVE, TAKE, and CALL\textemdash combines with another lexical verb. While the combinations we found are in important respects reminiscent of SVCs described for spoken languages, our data also confirm the previous finding that the fixed verb in the SVC serves to express agreement (by means of spatial modulation) when the other verb cannot do so. In addition, we identified some novel uses of the verbs GO and GIVE: (i) GO functioning as a future tense marker and (ii) GIVE functioning as a light verb. We will also discuss aspects of the grammaticalization of SVCs in NGT: from lexical verb to light verb to auxiliary, again offering some comparison to grammaticalization paths described for spoken languages.},

In all languages, this can be achieved by combining equative predication and participant nominalization, but in the evolution of languages, the routinization of such a construction as the usual way of expressing participant focalization may result in its grammaticalization as a specific type of construction. After proposing to reformulate the usual distinction between `pseudo-clefts' and `clefts' as a distinction between `plain clefts' and `grammaticalized clefts', this article discusses successively the relationship between cleft constructions and the notion of subordination, the changes that may convert plain clefts into grammaticalized clefts, the emergence of focus markers from cleft constructions, semantic aspects of the evolution of clefts, and the trend towards monoclausality in the evolution of clefts.},

Previously this conceptual model has been evidenced with children who can already read, however as orthographic knowledge can be used to complete phonological awareness tasks it cannot be said definitively that it is prosodic sensitivity influencing reading and spelling and not the reverse. Therefore, the present study sought to test the model in a longitudinal study conducted at the outset of reading development. A sample of 4- to 5-year-old English-speaking children (N\,=\,101) were assessed for their prosodic sensitivity, vocabulary knowledge, phonological and morphological awareness, and 1 year later (N\,=\,93) for their word reading and spelling. A path analysis revealed that the conceptual model provides an adequate fit to our sample data: prosodic sensitivity in pre-reading children predicts reading and spelling indirectly through other emergent literacy skills. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to models of literacy development and literacy instruction.},

We examine what causes a GU to be broken across Ws and identify three major constraints: parallelism, syntactic complexity in general, and distance. The converse of these principles, closeness and simplicity, determines the assignment of two GUs to a single IU. We examine the consequences of our analysis for grammaticalization theory, which includes the evolution of syntactic closeness, and for construction grammar and related processing models, which relate syntactic simplicity inversely to token frequency. We propose the {$<\lbrace$}IU storage hypothesis" to link together Ws, grammatical simplicity, and high token frequency.},

  abstract = {What are comparative concepts and how are they related to languagespecific categories used in language description? Three general categories of comparative concepts are defined here: purely functional comparative concepts and two types of hybrid formal-functional concepts, constructions and strategies. The two hybrid types provide more explicit and precise definitions of common typological practice. However a terminological issue is that Western grammatical terms are frequently used to describe strategies which are not universal rather than constructions which are. Language-specific categories appear to be radically different from comparative concepts because the former are defined distributionally whereas the latter are defined in universal functional and formal terms. But language-specific constructions have functions, that is, they are instances of constructions in the comparative sense and their form is an instantiation of a strategy. Typology forms generalizations across language-specific constructions in both their form and their function. Finally, a major issue is the confusion of terminological choices for language-specific categories. Four rules of thumb for useful labeling of language-specific categories, largely following best descriptive practice, are offered.},

The ITL has interested theoretical phonologists since Hayes' (1995) proposal that it may describe the perceptual underpinnings of the Foot Inventory (Hayes, 1995; McCarthy and Prince, 1986, 1996). This article surveys the growing experimental literature exploring perceptual ITL effects. The experimental findings to date suggest that ITL effects have both a ``nature'' and a ``nurture'' component, are documented for a variety of species, and are cross-modal in humans. Questions are raised as to whether there is likely to be a natural connection between ITL effects and the foot inventory.},

In this sense, conversations, being the most basic form of language use, should find space not only in the collection, but also in its oral annotation.

Previous research has shown that when a high-arousal face is presented along with the two moving objects, the bouncing percept was predominant, as compared with when a middle- or low-arousal face is presented. In this study, however, such a modulatory effect of the emotional face was eliminated when participants did not judge stream or bounce and the terms ``bouncing/streaming'' were not used in the experiments. These results suggest that the modulatory effect of emotional stimuli on the stream/bounce judgment cannot be explained solely by the emotional processing per se but, rather, can be modulated by language-based processing.},

Using television documentary recordings of disputes between traffic wardens and car owners as our data, we revisit the impoliteness framework mapped out in Culpeper [J. Prag. 25 (1996) 349]. Having justified why an impoliteness framework is needed, we explore the notion of impoliteness and consider whether the impoliteness strategies identified in Culpeper can be found in another discourse type. We argue that for impoliteness to be fully appreciated we need to move beyond the single strategy (lexically and grammatically defined) and examine both how impoliteness pans out in extended discourse and the role of prosody in conveying impoliteness. Our paper has important implications for politeness theory and discourse studies in general, and the role of prosody in discourse in particular.},

The research falls into three main areas: the use of prosody in the recognition of spoken words, in which most attention has been paid to the question of whether the prosodic structure of a word plays a role in initial activation of stored lexical representations; the use of prosody in the computation of syntactic structure, in which the resolution of global and local ambiguities has formed the central focus; and the role of prosody in the processing of discourse structure, in which there has been a preponderance of work on the contribution of accentuation and deaccentuation to integration of concepts with an existing discourse model. The review reveals that in each area progress has been made towards new conceptions of prosody's role in processing, and in particular this has involved abandonment of previously held deterministic views of the relationship between prosodic structure and other aspects of linguistic structure.},

However, there is debate over the robustness of the effect across cultures and the influence of orthography. We report an online experiment that tested the               bouba/kiki               effect across speakers of 25 languages representing nine language families and 10 writing systems. Overall, we found strong evidence for the effect across languages, with               bouba               eliciting more congruent responses than               kiki               . Participants who spoke languages with Roman scripts were only marginally more likely to show the effect, and analysis of the orthographic shape of the words in different scripts showed that the effect was no stronger for scripts that use rounder forms for               bouba               and spikier forms for               kiki               . These results confirm that the               bouba/kiki               phenomenon is rooted in crossmodal correspondence between aspects of the voice and visual shape, largely independent of orthography. They provide the strongest demonstration to date that the               bouba/kiki               effect is robust across cultures and writing systems.

This article provides an analysis of visual signals that comprise part of the intonational system of a sign language. The system is conveyed mainly by particular actions of the upper face, and is shown to pattern linguistically and predictably in Israeli Sign Language. Its components, aligned with prosodic constituents, are associated with particular but general meanings and may be combined to derive complex meanings. The Brow Raise component is functionally comparable to H tones, signaling continuation and dependency, and characterizing yes/no questions and the if -clause of conditionals, for example. The component Squint instructs the addressee to retrieve information that is not readily accessible, and characterizes relative clauses, topics, and other structures. The details of the componential analysis proposed here explain why the two components together co-occur on such seemingly diverse structures as yes/no questions about mutually retrievable information and counterfactual conditionals. Like auditorily perceived intonational melodies, the visual intonational arrays in sign language provide a subtle, intricately structured, and meaningful accompaniment to the words and sentences of language.},

Most proposed typological sampling methods are a priori in the sense that they are based on assumed, rather than observed, effects of biasing factors \textendash{} such as genealogical and areal proximity. The advent of the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) creates for the first time a chance to attempt a posteriori sampling. The basic idea is to create a sample by removing from the set of available languages one member of each pair of languages whose typological distance \textendash{} as defined in terms of the features in WALS \textendash{} does not reach a predefined threshold. In this way, a sample of 101 languages was chosen from an initial set of the 222 languages that are best represented in WALS. The number of languages from different macroareas in this sample can be taken as an indication of the internal diversity of the area in question. Two issues are discussed in some detail: (i) the high diversity of the indigenous languages of the Americas and the tendency for these to be underrepresented by previous sampling methods; (ii) the extreme areal convergence of Mainland South East Asian languages. It is concluded that areal factors cannot be neglected in typological sampling, and that it must be questioned whether the creation of elaborate sampling algorithms makes sense.},

It is argued that comparative concepts may be better subsumed under the notion of ``generalizing concept'', which is not tied to any specific level of analysis, and that the distinction between what is languagespecific and what is crosslinguistic is not absolute. Further, it is shown that crosslinguistic pattern clusters as identified in what is here called ``bottom-up typology'' meshes well with the homeostatic property cluster approach to biological species.},

This paper discusses a detailed description of the word formation processes that are relevant in Liangmai, namely affixation, compounding and reduplication. Affixation consists of prefixing and suffixing. Infixing is not found in the language. The process of compounding is used extensively in word formation in Liangmai. Compound words in Liangmai can be categorized according to the semantic criteria into endocentric and exocentric compounds. The resultant compounds in the language are almost exclusively nominal. Reduplication is also a common word formation process in the language. Both complete and partial reduplication are used and reduplicated words indicate concepts like distributive, exclusive, plurality, etc. Like other TB languages of the region, Liangmai is an agglutinative language.},

Liangmai have a productive strategy for forming causatives from all kinds of non-causative verbs. All verbs, intransitive and transitive, form their corresponding morphological causatives by prefixing the causative marker p\'i-. Another productive causative prefix used in the language is k\'am-, which causativises intransitive verbs. Besides these two morphological prefixal causative constructions, causative is also expressed lexically by suppletion in the language. The occurrence and the form of double causation is also discussed in the paper.},

In the first, chain-final morphology was reanalyzed as chain-medial morphology with different-subject switch reference meaning. In the second, common collocations of two verbs in a clause chain were reanalyzed as constituting a single compound verb stem. Previously, scholars held that increased structural integration of clauses necessarily results in structural asymmetry (that is, subordination), but the Sogeram data show that this need not always be the case. The cross-linguistic impulse towards increased integration is realized in both innovations, but the impulse towards asymmetry is only realized in the first. This paper thus argues that with coordinate source constructions such as these clause chains, one clause may become subordinate to the other, but the clauses may also retain their coordinate relationship as they become more integrated.},

Riddles appear in a parallel question-answer pair and may be divided into four different sets based on their structure and content: oppositional riddles, locational riddles, person(ified) riddles and action riddles. Metaphors draw from likeness in shape or movement, and to a minor extent from likeness in colour, texture, sound or function. Riddling is a highly endangered art form and this paper aims to document their beauty for posterity.},

  abstract = {Creaky phonation (also known as creaky voice, vocal fry, laryngealization, or glottalization) is a voice quality that refers to shortened and thickened vocal folds that vibrate at a low and quasi-regular fundamental frequency with a long period of damping. Cross-linguistically, creaky phonation can span either short or long domains. When implemented on individual vowels or consonants (as in Zapotec or Montana Salish), it can signal phonemic contrast with other voice qualities, or it can be an additional acoustic cue to enhance other contrasts, such as tone (as in Mandarin or Cantonese). Another segmental use of creaky phonation in many languages is as a variant of glottal stop. Creaky phonation can also be implemented as a prosodic element that signals the end of a phrase (as in English or Mandarin), or indicates relinquishing a conversational turn (as in Finnish). It can also express meaning in a social interaction, such as irritation (in Vietnamese). Lastly, creaky phonation can be deployed as a sociolinguistic marker to establish identities, convey affect, or distinguish one speech group from another within the same language. In some social circumstances, such as the perception that young women use creaky phonation at greater rates than men do, it can be evaluated negatively by listeners. As creaky phonation can be combined with linguistic elements at various levels and is easily perceptible, it has taken on a remarkable number of roles in our linguistic repertoires.},

  abstract = {Much of the literature on the phonetic realization of phonemic or allophonic glottal stop has shown that it is often not produced with full glottal closure. Some studies of languages like English or German suggest that full glottal closure might be more likely in stressed syllables or positions of prosodic prominence (Garellek, 2014; Kohler, 1994), but the conditioning factors in the realization of contrastive glottal stop are less well understood. This study focuses on Hawaiian, which has phonemic glottal stop that is contrastive in both word-initial (/{$\Elzglst$}aka/ `laugh' vs. /aka/ `shadow') and word-medial position (/pua/ `flower' vs. /pu{$\Elzglst$}a/ `to excrete') (Parker Jones, 2018). Glottal stop realization is examined with respect to three factors: word position, different vs. identical flanking vowel (/pu{$\Elzglst$}a/ `to excrete' vs. /pu{$\Elzglst$}u/ `hill'), and duration of the target /V(\#){$\Elzglst$}V/ sequence. Recordings from the Ka Leo Hawai'i Hawaiian language radio program that aired from 1972 to 1988 were examined. Results show that the majority of phonemic glottal stops are produced as a period of creaky voice, most often in a modal voice-creaky voicemodal voice configuration, but also as modal-creaky or creaky-modal. Full glottal stops were more likely in word-initial position, and identical flanking vowels led to longer periods of creaky voice. Shorter target intervals led to longer proportions of creaky voice. These findings for phonemic glottal stop are consistent with research on the timing of contrastive voice quality in vowels, which has shown that modal-nonmodal-modal patterns are preferred to ensure that vowel quality, voice quality, and tone (for languages with all three) are recoverable (Silverman, 1995/1997). The effects of word position and flanking vowel are also related to recoverability and segmentation. The potential articulatory configurations common to glottal stops and creaky voice which may explain why they are on a continuum are also discussed.},

  abstract = {This dissertation is about verse, some of its recurrent features, and cognitive aspects which can explain their prevalence. Verse includes a range of verbal phenomena, most typically songs and poems, but also nursery rhymes, religious chants or demonstration slogans. Compared to everyday speech, all these forms show additional layers of structure, like a regular alternation of accented syllables, a fixed melody, or a systematic number of syllables per utterance. Every linguistic community in the world engages in verse, but certain features seem suspiciously widespread.00On the one hand, I have developed computational tools in order to assess systematically how widespread individual verse features are. On the other hand, I have conducted behavioural experiments to investigate to which extent these widespread features may stem from properties of human cognition. Using these two approaches, the thesis examines three aspects of verse. The first part deals with constituent structure in verse and how it can emerge in the process of iterative learning. The second part measures final strictness in several languages, and proposes that it is a consequence of reduced attention at the beginning of lines. The last part develops a method to describe how linguistic and musical features are aligned in songs, and how to test the intuitions of native speakers experimentally. Although verse constitutes a prototypically creative activity subject to extensive cultural variability, it is nonetheless bound and shaped by our cognitive system.},

  abstract = {In Pitjantjatjara, a central Australian Indigenous language, speakers typically describe sequences of actions using clause chaining constructions. While similar constructions are common among the world's languages, very little is known about how children acquire them. A notable exception are the converb constructions of Turkish, which have been relatively well-studied. The present paper examines the acquisition of Pitjantjatara clause chaining constructions and compares this with the acquisition of Turkish converb constructions. Data is drawn from a naturalistic corpus recorded between 2016 and 2019. The corpus contains over 4000 utterances from 23 children aged between 10 months and 10 years, five of whom are recorded at multiple ages. The corpus also includes approximately 1600 utterances from 21 adults, aged between 16 and 70. Results show that the acquisition of Pitjantjatjara clause chains consists of three stages. Stage 1 features juxtaposition of finite verb forms. In Stage 2, children make regular use of clause chain morphology, but primarily for modification purposes. In Stage 3, clause chains are the preferred strategy for sequential actions as well as modification purposes. The initial use of verb juxtaposition followed by increasing use of dedicated morphology is consistent with findings for Turkish converb acquisition, with speakers of both languages utilizing dedicated forms from around 2;6 onwards. A notable difference between the acquisition of Pitjantjatjara clause chains and Turkish converbs is in the order of acquisition of semantic functions. In Turkish, children acquire temporal functions, such as sequential actions, before modifying functions, such as manner specification. In Pitjantjatjara, the order is reversed, with children first using clause chaining constructions for modification and simultaneous aspects of events before utilizing them to combine sequential actions. This raises questions regarding the distribution and relative timing of event combination and modification strategies.},

Corpus-based studies of the prosody of clause chains in two unrelated languages of Papua New Guinea report that they are typically produced as a sequence of Intonation phrases united by pitchscaling of the L\% boundary tones in each clause with only the final, finite, clause descending to a full L\%. The present study is the first experimental investigation of the prosody of clause chains in Pitjantjatjara.},

Working with spoken data, we claim that the basic discourse unit (BDU) is a multi-dimensional unit that should be defined in terms of two linguistic criteria: prosody and syntax. In this paper, we explain which criteria are used to perform the prosodic and syntactic segmentation, and how these levels are mapped onto one another. We discuss three types BDUs (one-to-one, syntax-bound, prosodybound) and open up a number of theoretical issues with respect to their function in discourse interpretation.},

It draws on a large set of data from a corpus of spoken British English. Its aim is twofold: first, it evaluates the correctness of previous claims about the intonational phrasing of parentheticals, specifically the assumption that parentheticals are phrased in a separate intonation domain; second, it discusses the implications of the intonational phrasing of parentheticals for prosodic theory. The results of the data analysis are as follows. First, the longer types of interpolations but not CCs are by default phrased separately. Second, both the temporal and the tonal structure of the host may be affected by the parenthetical. Third, CCs lend themselves more readily to the restructuring of intonational phrases such that they are phrased in one domain together with material from the host. Fourth, the prosodic results cannot be explained in syntactic accounts which do not allow for a syntactic relation between parenthetical and host. Fifth, the interface constraints on intonational phrasing apply to parentheticals. Sixth, the intonational phrasing of parentheticals supports the assumption of a post-syntactic, phonological component of the grammar at which restructuring applies.},

The occurrence of pauses of 52 L2 and 18 L1 Dutch speakers was evaluated with respect to utterance boundaries and word frequency. We found that L2 speakers paused more often than L1 speakers within utterances; but not between utterances. Similarly, only within utterances, L2 pauses were longer than L1 pauses. Regarding word frequency, both L1 and L2 speakers are more likely to pause before lower frequency words as compared to higher frequency words. These findings imply that L1 and L2 speakers' production processes may be similar in that (1) pauses at utterance boundaries are used for conceptual planning mostly and (2) lexical retrieval difficulties are comparable for L1 and L2 speakers. These findings furthermore imply that when using fluency for L2 testing, pause locations must be taken into account.},

We reinterpret results from two experiments in which articulator movements were recorded for utterances varying in pitch accent placement. In the f i s t experiment, jaw kinematics were studied in post-nuclear unaccented and nuclear accented [pap] syllables. The kinematic patterns suggested that gestures in syllables with greater stress (nuclear accented) show less coarticulatory overlap. By contrast, the vowel's low jaw target is undershot in unaccented syllables. Two hypotheses are possible. Either the jaw is lower in stressed syllables so more energy can radiate from the mouth (``sonority expansion'') or the jaw is lower to help distinguish the low vowel from other vowels (``hyperarticulation''). Another experiment differentiates the two hypotheses by examining tongue point positions in [put] preceding a [a]. In the more stressed syllables, the tongue dorsum retracts more, likely to make a more distinct back vowel. Also, the amount of assimilation of the alveolar stop to the following dental is feduced. Both results suggest hyperarticulation rather than sonority expansion. Thus, it seems that coarticulation is reduced in stressed syllables, because stressed syllables are hyperarticulated.},

Grammatical relations between words are centrally used to explain how predicate\textendash argument structures are encoded morphosyntactically in different languages while morphological features and part-of-speech classes give the properties of words. We argue that this theory is a good basis for crosslinguistically consistent annotation of typologically diverse languages in a way that supports computational natural language understanding as well as broader linguistic studies.},

First, a syntactic account of the role of this morpheme posits a morphologically realized endpoint in Inner Aspect within the predicate.

Our results confirm earlier observations that the logarithmic duration of the pauses can be well approximated by a bi-Gaussian distribution. We found this also to be true at slow and fast speaking rates. Our analysis further shows that, as far as the long speech pauses are concerned, similar strategies are used in all languages considered. For speaking slowly, speakers increase the total amount of pauses and they use a wider range of pause durations. Overall, there appeared to be no striking change in the average, nor in the variance of the distribution of the pause durations. For speaking rapidly, speakers decrease the amount of pauses used and they refrain from using the longest pauses that occur in their normal speech. Overall, this results in a lower average and a smaller variance of the pause durations.},

  abstract = {The vocabulary of human languages has been argued to support efficient communication by optimizing the trade-off between complexity and informativeness (Kemp \& Regier 2012). The argument has been based on cross-linguistic analyses of vocabulary in semantic domains of content words such as kinship, color, and number terms. The present work extends this analysis to a category of function words: indefinite pronouns (e.g. someone, anyone, no-one, cf. Haspelmath 2001). We build on previous work to establish the meaning space and featural make-up for indefinite pronouns, and show that indefinite pronoun systems across languages optimize the complexity/informativeness trade-off. This demonstrates that pressures for efficient communication shape both content and function word categories, thus tying in with the conclusions of recent work on quantifiers by Steinert-Threlkeld (2019). Furthermore, we argue that the trade-off may explain some of the universal properties of indefinite pronouns, thus reducing the explanatory load for linguistic theories.},

  abstract = {While it has long been assumed that prosody can help resolve syntactic and semantic ambiguities, empirical evidence has shown that the mapping between prosody and meaning is complex (Hirschberg \&amp; Avesani 2000; Jackendoff 1972). This paper investigates the prosody of ambiguous French sentences with multiple potentially negative terms that allow two semantically very distinct interpretations\textemdash a single negation reading involving negative concord (NC), and a double negative reading (DN) with a positive meaning reflecting a strictly compositional interpretation\textemdash{} with the goal to further research on the role of prosody in ambiguities by examining whether intonation can be recruited by speakers to signal distinct interpretations of these sentences to hearers. Twenty native speakers produced transitive sentences with potentially negative terms embedded in contexts designed to elicit single-negation or double-negation readings. Analysis regarding the F0 and the duration of the utterances revealed distinct prosodic profiles for the two readings, confirming previous evidence that speakers can produce characteristic acoustic cues to signal intended distinctive meanings (Kraljic \&amp; Brennan 2005; Syrett, Simon \&amp; Nisula 2014). Our results reveal that the NC readings feature a focused subject and a post-focally more compressed object, in contrast to the DN readings where both the subject and the object were independently focused. They do not relate DN to contradiction but link negative meaning with focus on French negative concord items (NCI). The paper discusses broad implications of these findings for theoretical approaches to NC and outlines further questions for the syntax-prosody interface of these constructions.},

In this paper, I argue that not just any kind of cultural accumulation will give rise to human-like culture. Rather, I suggest that human CCE depends on the gradual exploitation of natural phenomena, which are features of our environment that, through the laws of physics, chemistry or biology, generate reliable effects which can be exploited for a purpose. I argue that CCE comprises two distinct processes: optimizing cultural traits that exploit a given set of natural phenomena (Type I CCE) and expanding the set of natural phenomena we exploit (Type II CCE). I argue that the most critical features of human CCE, including its open-ended dynamic, stems from Type II CCE. Throughout the paper, I contrast the two processes and discuss their respective socio-cognitive requirements.

  abstract = {Menggwa Dla \textemdash{} a Papuan language spoken in Papua New Guinea and West Papua \textemdash{} possesses a switch-reference (SR) system which traditionally functions like those in many other Papuan languages: coreferential (CR) chain verb forms indicate the coreference of the interclausal subjects, and the disjoint-referential (DR) chain verb forms indicate the disjoint-reference of the interclausal subjects. However, in the speech of younger speakers, the SR function of the SR markers has only been retained when the person-number-gender features of the subject cross-reference suffixes are incapable of disambiguating their referentiality. Otherwise, the CR chain verb forms have become unmarked (SR-neutral) chain verb forms, and while the DR chain verb forms still indicate the disjoint-reference of the interclausal subjects, the DR chain verb forms are mainly used to indicate some sort of discourse discontinuity (e.g. temporal discontinuity, logic discontinuity) in addition to participant discontinuity. SR systems can be shown to be serving two different functions: reference-tracking, and the indication of discourse participant continuity versus discontinuity (e.g. Stirling 1993). The latter is the primary function of canonical SR systems. It will be demonstrated that the traditional SR system in Menggwa Dla is a canonical SR system which indicates participant continuity versus discontinuity, whereas the innovative SR system \textemdash{} as used by younger speakers \textemdash{} is more biased towards the function of reference-tracking.},

  abstract = {Reanalysis is recognized as a key concept of grammatical change across theoretical frameworks. Despite its widespread use, its role and nature are controversially discussed in current research. Introducing this special issue, our paper gives an overview of major positions that have been proposed, as well as of the papers in this issue. This will allow us to identify core elements of reanalysis as well as points of debate concerning, e.g., the definition of reanalysis and its subtypes, the role of ambiguity and different types of constraints, features such as directionality, abruptness/gradualness and the covert nature of reanalysis. Further issues include the roles of speaker and hearer, language acquisition, language contact, high and low frequency scenarios, and the relationship between grammaticalization, analogy and reanalysis. We will show that some of the controversies arise from differences in basic assumptions about linguistic structures and language change in general. We will argue that processes at the individual level and at the level of speech communities should not be confounded, and that reanalysis as hearer-induced innovation needs to be distinguished from reanalysis as ratification. Finally, we will highlight a range of perspectives for further research on reanalysis that can inform research on language change and related matters more broadly. {${_\ast}$} This discussion paper was inspired by the workshop ``Whither Reanalysis?''

But these leave fundamental questions unanswered: what do speakers/hearers actually do when they "grammaticalize"/"reanalyze" a linguistic item? We will show reanalysis to be essentially a hearer-based procedure. Listeners aim at understanding what speakers say. Grammaticalization, on the other hand, is a speaker-based phenomenon: Speakers invent expressive discourse techniques in order to pay tribute to basic communicative needs such as "to tell the truth", "to be relevant"; as a consequence of routinization, these techniques will lose their salience and their relics end up by becoming part of the grammar. Like any type of change, grammaticalization is ratified by reanalyses on the part of listeners. In a trivial sense, lexical elements are reanalyzed as grammatical ones. Only in this sense are reanalysis and grammaticalization "inseparable twins".},

  abstract = {Papuan speech communities in New Guinea share a number of specific discourse preferences that are used in similar ways in certain genres. This article focuses on three discourse practices as they operate in narrative texts; thematization (a strong preference for Theme, Predication or Left Dislocation constructions), distribution (a strong preference to distribute nominals over series of clauses and of modifiers over series of phrases) and recapitulative linkage (connecting clause chains or sentences by tail\textendash head linkage). Thematization occurs especially in discourse initial paragraphs when the time, place, participant and main themes are introduced, and in discourse final paragraphs with summarizing and concluding functions. Thematization combines with non-distributive forms in these contexts to form discourse units in which the number and complexity of nominal phrases is relatively high. Such thematic parts are not organized around progression of events and recapitulative linkage is hardly present. Once the story is underway, distributive tendencies become more dominant, with unmarked, chained forms of recapitulative linkage connecting the often lengthy and `verby' sentences into chaining paragraphs. When marked, thematized recapitulative linkage occurs, this signals thematic discontinuity. Many aspects of the typology of Papuan languages, from demonstrative topic markers to experiential, subordinate and perception complement constructions, can be understood from the perspective of these areal discourse preferences of Papuan speakers. But the identification of these areal pragmatic patterns not only enhances our understanding of the specific nature of Papuan languages, it also has crucial methodological implications for the way field linguists transcribe and analyse whole texts or single expressions from these languages. Ignoring these discourse practices may lead to serious distortions in the transcription and collection of data and in the grammatical description of these languages.},

They form a dialect chain that represents stages of the development from clause conjoining with independent verb forms to clause chaining with dependent verb forms that express switch-reference. South Wambon represents the first stage in which there is coordination reduction of tense and subject person-number suffixes in thematic continuity conditions. This process created three verb types: fully finite verbs; semi-finite verbs and non-finite verbs. Coordination reduction leaves the coordinating conjunctions intact and this explains the presence of coordinators with all verb types, including dependent verbs. Coordination reduction creates verb forms that signal subject continuity but it does not create subject discontinuity forms and there is no switch-reference in South Wambon. However, the introduction of dependent subject continuity forms gives South Wambon speakers a choice in subject continuity conditions between dependent forms and independent verb forms. Since speakers prefer dependent forms under these conditions, a frequency pattern emerges that associates independent forms with subject discontinuity conditions and that sets the stage for the development of medial verb forms and switch-reference. North Wambon and Mandobo represent the second stage in which subject discontinuity forms develop. North Wambon transforms conjoined semi-finite independent verbs into two types of special medial verb forms that express switch-reference. In Mandobo any medially occurring independent verb form is reinterpreted as a Different Subject form. The two-stage hypothesis revives the coordination reduction theory of Haiman (1983a) as an explanation for the origin of (certain) switch-reference systems by viewing coordination reduction as an explanation of SS forms only. In this way, the two-stage theory overcomes the problems of limited applicability that Roberts (1997: 190) noted for the original theory of Haiman (1983a).},

Oxford: Blackwell; Yip, Moira. 2002. Tone. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press). Tones remain stable even if their tone-bearing unit changes or is deleted. In the context of historical sound change, tones may either persist as floating tones (from an autosegmental-metrical perspective) or fuse with adjacent syllables and give rise to more complex tonal inventories. However, the process of segmental loss which ultimately conditions historical tonal change is gradual in nature. Tone-bearing units may lenite or they may be optionally realized, leading listeners to rely on coarticulatory cues or phonetic information on adjacent syllables. In the current paper, I examine how variation in the realization of clitic pronouns is conditioned by adjacent tonal cues in Itunyoso Triqui (Otomanguean) within a corpus of spontaneous speech recordings. This research examines and provides evidence for the hypothesis that tonally conditioned allomorphy arises specifically when two conditions are met: (a) there is a morphological context where prosodic units are likely to lenite (highly redundant contexts); and (b) adjacent tonal cues are most informative at this morphophonological boundary. The findings shed light not only on how phonologically conditioned allomorphy arises but also on how variable deletion is sensitive to patterns of multiple exponence during language use.},

  abstract = {Word-level prosody plays an important role in processes of consonant lenition. Typically, consonants in word-initial position are strengthened while those in word-medial position are lenited (Keating, Cho, Fougeron, \& Hsu, 2003). In this paper we examine the relationship between word-prosodic position and obstruent lenition in a spontaneous speech corpus of Yolox\'ochitl Mixtec, an endangered Mixtecan language spoken in Mexico. The language exhibits a surprising amount of lenition in the realization of otherwise voiceless unaspirated stops and voiceless fricatives in careful speech. In Experiment 1, we examine the relationships between word position, consonant duration, and passive voicing and find that word-medial pre-tonic position is the locus of both consonant lengthening and less passive voicing. Non-pre-tonic consonants are produced with more voicing and shorter duration. We also find that the functional status of the morpheme plays a role in voicing lenition. In Experiment 2, we examine manner lenition and find a similar pattern \textendash{} word-medial pre-tonic stops are more often realized with complete closure relative to non-pre-tonic stops, which are more often realized with incomplete closure. In Experiment 3, we model these lenition patterns using a series of deep neural networks and find that, even with limited training data, we can achieve reasonably high accuracy in the automatic categorization of lenition patterns. The results of this research both complement recent work on the phonetics of lenition in the world's languages (Katz and Fricke, 2018; White et al., 2020) and provide computational tools for modeling and predicting patterns of extreme lenition.},

In botany, his own speciality, Martius developed a huge taxonomical work that has remained valid until now. Nevertheless, the studies he took on in the fields of history, ethnography and, above all, linguistics regarding the indigenous nations of Brazil reveal an extraordinary know-how, and his work rivals the most advanced research of his contemporary scholars. In fact, he established a key role to his language observations in order to explain the most distant indigenous history. To achieve this, Martius followed the ideas of several renowned linguists of the German tradition, namely Wilhelm von Humboldt and Jacob Grimm. This article goes over Martius' publications in social sciences, focusing on his linguistic investigation, and examines the path he followed to master the methodological tools required to achieve his goal.},

There is evidence from a wide range of studies that the language user's knowledge of constructions includes detailed information about specific words, which influences sentence comprehension and production and diachronic language change. The current paper provides an overview of this research and considers the cognitive mechanisms that underlie the emergence of lexically particular constructions. Researchers agree that frequency affects the inter\- action between lexemes and constructions; but the cognitive effects of frequency on lexical specificity are not yet fully understood. Some usage-based linguists have argued that the exemplar mechanism of category learning accounts for the redundant storage of lexically particular constructions alongside more general, i.\hspace{0.166em}e. schematic syntactic representations; but the current paper argues that the exemplar model needs to be augmented by a linear processing mechanism, i.\hspace{0.166em}e. automatization, in order to explain how lexemes and constructions are related.},

However, while researchers agree that these results characterize grammar as an emergent phenomenon, there is no consensus among usage-based scholars as to how the various results can be explained and integrated into an explicit theory or model. Building on network theory, the current paper outlines a structured network approach to the study of grammar in which the core concepts of syntax are analyzed by a set of relations that specify associations between different aspects of a speaker's linguistic knowledge. These associations are shaped by domain-general processes that can give rise to new structures and meanings in language acquisition and language change. Combining research from linguistics and psychology, the paper proposes specific network analyses for the following phenomena: argument structure, word classes, constituent structure, constructions and construction families, and grammatical categories such as voice, case and number. The article builds on data and analyses presented in               Diessel (2019               ;               The Grammar Network.

Several unusual grammatical gender systems are reported for this area, but there has been a lack of comprehensive comparative studies. This article is a typological investigation of northwestern Bantu gender systems based on a sample of 179 languages. We study the distribution of various patterns of animacy-based agreement in the languages of the sample and in relationship with the Agreement Hierarchy. We find that animacy-based agreement is widespread in northwestern Bantu. If restricted to animate nouns, it tends to coexist in stable variation with syntactic agreement. When generalized to both animate and inanimate nouns, animacy-based agreement appears to contribute to the erosion of gender marking. In line with the prediction of the Agreement Hierarchy, we find that animacy-based agreement is prevalent with verbs and pronouns. Within the noun phrase, it spreads in ways that are suggestive of a hierarchy of syntactic integration between nouns and adnominal modifiers, which had gone unnoticed in the existing literature. These results have important implications for current models of Bantu gender systems and shed new light on animacy effects in the diachrony of gender more generally.},

Ideophones are marked words that depict sensory imagery, often identified by their reduplicated forms. Yet not all reduplication is iconic, and not all ideophones are reduplicated. This paper discusses the semantics and pragmatics of repeated talk with special reference to ideophones. To understand these phenomena, it is useful to distinguish two modes of representation in language \textemdash{} description and depiction \textemdash{} along with cues like prosodic foregrounding that help steer listener's interpretations from one to the other. Reduplication can partake in both modes, which is why it is common in ideophones and other areas of grammar. Using evidence from a range of languages, this paper shows how the study of ideophones sheds light on the interpretation of repeated talk, and argues that both description and depiction are fundamental to understanding how language works.},

We take stock of formats for initiating repair across languages (comparable to English huh?, who?, y'mean X?, etc.) and find that different languages make available a wide but remarkably similar range of linguistic resources for this function. We exploit the patterned variation as evidence for several underlying concerns addressed by repair initiation: characterising trouble, managing responsibility, and handling knowledge. The concerns do not always point in the same direction and thus provide participants in interaction with alternative principles for selecting one format over possible others. By comparing conversational structures across languages, this paper contributes to pragmatic typology: the typology of systems of language use and the principles that shape them.},

  abstract = {Recent discussions about reproducibility in linguistics emphasize that access to the original documentation allows analyses to be checked against the data that underlie them. But every annotated recording is itself always an interpretation, with some information and perspectives highlighted and some obscured. For this reason, access to the original documentation offers something better than scientific accountability: it offers a view into the underlying acts of interpretation made by other researchers and the consultants and assistants they worked with. These acts of interpretation \textendash even problematic or ``incorrect'' ones \textendash{} can generate insight into both linguistic structure and the social relations developed and mobilized in the context of research. This point is illustrated through analysis of legacy documentation of the Bukiyip variety of Arapesh (Papua New Guinea), which was collected fifty years ago by SIL linguist Robert Conrad and transcribed by a native speaker. Analyzing the transcribed texts against the original recordings shows the transcriptions to be problematic, with significant stretches of speech elided and ``corrections'' introduced by the transcriber. Yet these discrepancies do something more valuable than disconfirm the texts' validity: they reveal linguistic patterns that would otherwise go undetected, and in some cases are only detectable now because of the discrepancies.},

  abstract = {Documentary linguistic data may be acquired not only firsthand, but by consulting materials that were produced by scholars, missionaries, speakers, and others in the past. Such linguistic legacy materials may reside in an archive or in an individual's private collection, or they may be embedded in published literature that was created for purposes other than linguistics. In this introduction to a special issue of Language Documentation and Description, we explore some of the reasons why linguistic legacy materials, while potentially treasure troves of evidence and insight, are nevertheless challenging to use. The main challenge, we argue, is inherent in the very nature of such materials: inasmuch as they are the products of past human meaning-making activity, they are invested with the goals, knowledge, points of view, and circumstances of those who were involved in their creation. To that extent, legacy materials can be said to possess social lives that originate in the past and that continue to unfold over time as they are accessed, analyzed, or put to new uses. The articles published together here tell the ``biographies'' of linguistic legacy materials in particular instances, drawing lessons for all who revisit and recirculate data from the past and offering perspective for documentary linguists working now to create the legacy collections of the future.},

This grammar provides the first comprehensive{$<$}br{$>$} description of a Yam language. It is based on 16 months of fieldwork. The primary source of data{$<$}br{$>$} is a text corpus of around 12 hours recorded and transcribed between 2010 and 2015.{$<$}br{$>$} Komnzo provides many fields of future research, but the most interesting aspect of its structure lies in the verb morphology, to which the two largest chapters of the grammar are dedicated.{$<$}br{$>$} Komnzo verbs may index up to two arguments showing agreement in person, number and gen-{$<$}br{$>$} der. Verbs encode 18 TAM categories, valency, directionality and deictic status. Morphological{$<$}br{$>$} complexity lies not only in the amount of categories that verbs may express, but also in the way{$<$}br{$>$} these are encoded. Komnzo verbs exhibit what may be called `distributed exponence', i.e. single{$<$}br{$>$} morphemes are underspecified for a particular grammatical category. Therefore, morphological{$<$}br{$>$} material from different sites has to be integrated first, and only after this integration can one{$<$}br{$>$} arrive at a particular grammatical category.{$<$}br{$>$} The descriptive approach in this grammar is theory-informed rather than theory-driven. Comparison to other Yam languages and diachronic developments are taken into account whenever{$<$}br{$>$} it seems helpful.},

  abstract = {Cross-linguistically, morphomes are empirically robust but there are few well-studied cases outside of Romance. We analyze the distribution of present and aorist stems in Western Armenian, an understudied Indo-European language. Canonically, the aorist encodes perfective aspect, but it is meaninglessly used in different paradigm cells for different conjugation classes. For these meaningless cases, the aorist stem acts as a morphomic item. The shape of the aorist stem varies across conjugation classes, including regular classes that use a dedicated aorist suffix vs. irregular classes that use root suppletion. This parallelism across the regular and irregular verbs further establishes that the aorist stem is a legitimate morphological item, and not just a set of homophonous items. We formalize the data in Distributed Morphology, a post-syntactic morphological framework. We use head-insertion or node-sprouting to model how the aorist suffix has canonical perfective semantics, but it is meaninglessly inserted by the morphology in non-perfective contexts. We find that the creation of the aorist stem occurs early in the derivation, and it cyclically interacts with allomorphy and morphophonological alternations. In sum, the morphomic aorist is well-integrated into Armenian morphotactics, and morphomic elements interact with other morphological operations.},

On the basis of evidence from Dutch, we show that certain generalizations and rules cannot be expressed without having roots that are lexically specified for their category. Furthermore, we show that the arguments put forward by Barner and Bale (2002) for categorial underspecification are not valid with respect to the data from Dutch. Finally, following Kiparsky (1997), we show that analyses of denominal verbs in English that embrace the categorial underspecification hypothesis run into serious problems. We conclude that roots are stored in the lexicon with a categorial specification.},

Beyond the clause level, prosody is especially helpful in structuring oral narratives in which long stretches of speech convey complex stories involving multiple characters and events. An acoustic and statistical analysis of prosodic cues in folktales in Eyak, a relative of the Athabaskan language family, demonstrates that pause, lag, rush, boundary tone, pitch reset and tune are combined in various ways to define intonation units, while sentence and paragraph boundaries are largely demarcated by pause and boundary tone. This intonational framework is also shown to be a flexible one; variation in degree may be employed to change the overall mood of a particular tale.},

Following this I examine the range of stems that can possibly be called `bipartite stems', and those that certainly can be, concluding that the label is not a useful one in describing Skou, which shows more complexities than a simple `{$\pm$}bipartite' dichotomy can capture. A survey of `bipartite' phenomena in related and geographically close languages follows, with the conclusion that prosodic factors at least as much as morphological ones, and the possibility of an infixal analysis, rob the label `bipartite' of much of its useful content when applied outside the domain for which it was originally devised.},

  abstract = {Examining syntactic categories in Tukang Besi, an Austronesian language of Indonesia, we find that there are additions to the traditional fixed categories. In addition to the firmly definable categories of nouns and verbs, there are many lexical items that are precategorial: they may be used, without derivation, with either nominal morphosyntax or verbal morphosyntax. Additionally, there is a class of `adjectives' that display odd behaviour in terms of morphological markedness reversals and functional use, and which, under closer examination, turn out to have a variable categorial status, dependent on the structural position in which they are used, obligatorily appearing as part of the head of their phrase, V in a VP and N in an NP. Morphosyntactic tests for the different claims are given and discussed.},

One consistent theme in many studies is the desire to categorize, or `typologise', a language by reference to labels such as `nominative', `ergative', `hierarchical', etc. Even when different parts of the language are considered separately, descriptions such as `nominative-accusative verb agreement and ergative case marking' are common. In this chapter we examine Iha, a language of western Papua New Guinea, and discover that we have a language which shows four different `alignment patterns' on its verbs alone, proving that the only descriptively adequate typology must be one that critically examines languages in terms of component parts, and not just gross categorization.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses ergativity in Bumthang. In 2016, Donohue \& Donohue reported on the variable use of the ergative case marker in Bumthang transitive clauses. They identified a number of largely pragmatic, semantic, and informational structural contexts that license the use of the ergative case on the subjects. Given the nature of the factors involved we examined similar conditions for arguments of monovalent verbs, not a typical context for receiving ergative case if structural conditions were uniquely determining case, but which would likely also be sensitive to these same factors. We find that there are some contexts in which the sole argument of an monovalent verb can bear ergative case, drawing on some of the same features, but not identical to those relevant for transitive verbs. In particular, the notion of agentivity is of paramount importance for licensing ergative case arguments of monovalent verbs, and we discuss the set of factors that need to coincide for this to happen.},

  abstract = {Double verb constructions known as hendiadys have been studied primarily in literary texts and corpora of written language. Much less is known about their properties and usage in spoken language, where expressions such as `come and see', `go and tell', `sit and talk' are particularly common, and where we can find an even richer diversity of other constructions. In this study, we investigate hendiadys in corpora of naturally occurring social interactions in four languages, Danish, English (US and UK), Finnish and Italian, with the objective of exploring whether hendiadys is used systematically in recurrent interactional and sequential circumstances, from which it is possible to identify the pragmatic function(s) that hendiadys may serve. Examining hendiadys in conversation also offers us a special window into its grammatical properties, for example when a speaker self-corrects from a non-hendiadic to a hendiadic expression, exposing the boundary between related grammatical forms and demonstrating the distinctiveness of hendiadys in context. More broadly, we demonstrate that hendiadys is systematically associated with talk about complainable matters, in environments characterised by a conflict, dissonance, or friction that is ongoing in the interaction or that is being reported by one participant to another. We also find that the utterance in which hendiadys is used is typically in a subsequent and possibly terminal position in the sequence, summarising or concluding it. Another key finding is that the complainable or conflictual element in these interactions is expressed primarily by the first conjunct of the hendiadic construction. Whilst the first conjunct is semantically subsidiary to the second, it is pragmatically the most important one. This analysis leads us to revisit a long-established asymmetry between the verbal components of hendiadys, and to bring to light the synergy of grammar and pragmatics in language usage.},

In the case where the apparent correlation turns out to be an illusion, namely between tone and the order of object and verb, the illusion arises because most of the tone languages in WALS are in two areas which happen to be primarily VO. This illustrates the need to examine how the languages are distributed geographically. But this is information that WALS also provides, on the maps.},

One interpretation is the question whether the Walman diminutive is an instance of a crosslinguistic category of gender. I argue that this interpretation is problematic since it assumes the existence of crosslinguistic categories and I argue that there is no reason to believe that crosslinguistic categories exist, since the similarities among languages can be explained without appeal to crosslinguistic categories. A second interpretation involves a question of how the diminutive fits into the grammar of Walman, whether the diminutive should be considered a third value of a feature in the grammar of Walman which has two clear values, masculine and feminine. I argue that the evidence supports the view that the Walman diminutive is not a gender in this sense. The third interpretation is whether the Walman diminutive is an instance of a comparative concept of gender. But the answer to that question depends on how one defines gender as a comparative concept.},

For this purpose, we created a corpus from LREC and ACL articles from the above-mentioned periods, from which we manually annotated nearly 1,000. We then developed two classifiers to automatically annotate the rest of the corpus. We show that LREC articles tend to respect the \#BenderRule (80 to 90\% of them respect it), whereas only around half of ACL articles do. Interestingly, over the considered periods, the results appear to be stable for the two conferences, even though a rebound in ACL 2020 could be a sign of the influence of the blog post about the \#BenderRule.},

This paper uses the Oswalt Monte Carlo Shift test (a variant of Oswalt 1970) to explore the statistical basis of the claim that the four Papuan languages of the Solomon Islands have greater than chance levels of lexical similarity. The results of this test initially appear to show that the lexical similarities between the Central Solomons Papuan languages are statistically significant, but the effect disappears when known Oceanic loanwords are removed. The Oswalt Monte Carlo test is a useful technique to test a claim of greater than chance similarity between any two word lists \textemdash{} with the proviso that undetected loanwords strongly increase the chance of spurious identification.},

This has led certain philosophers and linguists to suggest that this identification is not as implausible as it once seemed. In this paper, I discuss the prospects for such an identification in light of these developments in linguistic theory. I raise a new challenge against the identification thesis: the existence of ungrammatical but acceptable expressions seems to require a gap between thought and language. I consider what must be the case in order for this objection to be dealt with.},

Infants of this age are also in the early stages of vocabulary development, producing their first words at around 12 months. The present work examined whether there are meaningful individual differences in infants' ability to represent dynamic causal events in visual scenes, and whether these differences influence vocabulary development. As part of the longitudinal Language 0\textendash 5 Project, 78 10-month-old infants were tested on their ability to interpret three dynamic motion events, involving (a) caused-motion, (b) chasing behaviour, and (c) goaldirected movement. Planned analyses found that infants showed evidence of understanding the first two event types, but not the third. Looking behaviour in each task was not meaningfully related to vocabulary development, nor were there any correlations between the tasks. The results of additional exploratory analyses and simulations suggested that the infants' understanding of each event may not be predictive of their vocabulary development, and that looking times in these tasks may not be reliably capturing any meaningful individual differences in their knowledge. This raises questions about how to convert experimental group designs to individual differences measures, and how to interpret infant looking time behaviour.},

However, the metrics developed to measure this similarity to date have generally failed to capture the dynamic temporal aspects of this process. In this paper, we propose new approaches to measuring interlocutor similarity in spoken dialogue. We define similarity in terms of convergence and synchrony and propose approaches to capture these, illustrating our techniques on gap and pause production in Swedish spontaneous dialogues.},

  abstract = {The Nuosu (Nosu) Yi language, or Northern Yi (北部彝语), is spoken by approximately two million people in southern Sichuan Province and northern Yunnan Province, China, the majority of whom are monolingual. Yi is a member of the Yi Branch of the Lolo-Burmese subgroup of the Tibeto-Burman family (Benedict 1972/2009, Bradley 1979), which includes some 50 languages, also called the Nisoic languages (Lama 2012) or Ngwi Group. The large (5 million) ethnic Yi nationality groups of Yunnan Province are distantly related. The third author, Lama Ziwo, who was 31 at the time of recording, produced, translated and transcribed the recorded audio data phonemically and participated in the laryngoscopic filming of the video data. He is a native speaker of the Suondip/Suondi dialect, and a fluent speaker of the Shypnra/Shengza dialect. It is the Shypnra/Shengza standard dialect that is being represented in this paper. The most distinguishing phonetic feature of Northern Yi is its systematic vocal register contrast (Matisoff 1972, Dai 1990) between two settings of the laryngeal constrictor mechanism, which are referred to as a lax (unconstricted) series and a tense (constricted) series (Edmondson et al. 2000, 2001). The contrast is realized as a distinction in resonance (spectral quality) rather than as contrasting phonation types as in some other forms of Yi or in other Tibeto-Burman languages (e.g. Bai). The consonantal inventory is large, with complex vocalic interactions, including interactions with two pairs of fricativized vowels. Northern Yi has 43 initial consonants, five pairs of vowels (or syllable rhymes), and three tones: 55, 33, and 21. Relevant reports on voice quality in related languages can be found in Maddieson \& Ladefoged (1985) and Sun \& Liu (1986).},

In contrast to the most widely accepted account of FID, which compares the content of FID to the surrounding content (two voices or two contexts), we take FID as a discourse entity and, thus, focus on the FID event. We follow a prominence-based approach to temporal discourse structure, through which we are able to describe the temporal relations the FID event maintains to the preceding and the following discourse in a precise manner. We can also account for the temporal developments that may be brought about by FID events. This becomes especially interesting in longer passages where FID events alternate with non-FID parts of discourse. The interaction involves the three levels which together make up our account of temporal discourse structure.},

Previous research suggests that predictability varies over time, with increases in prediction error at those moments that people perceive as boundaries between meaningful events. These moments also tend to be points of rapid change in the environment. Eye tracking provides a method for noninterruptive measurement of prediction as participants watch a movie of an actor performing a series of actions. In two studies, we used eye tracking to study the time course of prediction around event boundaries. In both studies, viewers looked at objects that were about to be touched by the actor shortly before the objects were contacted, demonstrating predictive looking. However, this behavior was modulated by event boundaries: looks to to-be-contacted objects near event boundaries were less likely to be early and more likely to be late compared to looks to objects contacted within events. This result is consistent with theories proposing that event segmentation results from transient increases in prediction error.},

  abstract = {The use of spoken and written language is a capacity that is unique to humans. Individual differences in reading- and language-related skills are influenced by genetic variation, with twin-based heritability estimates of 30-80\%, depending on the trait. The relevant genetic architecture is complex, heterogeneous, and multifactorial, and yet to be investigated with well-powered studies. Here, we present a multicohort genome-wide association study (GWAS) of five traits assessed individually using psychometric measures: word reading, nonword reading, spelling, phoneme awareness, and nonword repetition, with total sample sizes ranging from 13,633 to 33,959 participants aged 5-26 years (12,411 to 27,180 for those with European ancestry, defined by principal component analyses). We identified a genome-wide significant association with word reading (rs11208009, p=1.098 x 10-8) independent of known loci associated with intelligence or educational attainment. All five reading-/language-related traits had robust SNP-heritability estimates (0.13\textendash 0.26), and genetic correlations between them were modest to high. Using genomic structural equation modelling, we found evidence for a shared genetic factor explaining the majority of variation in word and nonword reading, spelling, and phoneme awareness, which only partially overlapped with genetic variation contributing to nonword repetition, intelligence and educational attainment. A multivariate GWAS was performed to jointly analyse word and nonword reading, spelling, and phoneme awareness, maximizing power for follow-up investigation. Genetic correlation analysis of multivariate GWAS results with neuroimaging traits identified association with cortical surface area of the banks of the left superior temporal sulcus, a brain region with known links to processing of spoken and written language. Analysis of evolutionary annotations on the lineage that led to modern humans showed enriched heritability in regions depleted of Neanderthal variants. Together, these results provide new avenues for deciphering the biological underpinnings of these uniquely human traits.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have highlighted divergent change as a more common outcome of language contact than previously thought. While convergent change is often attributed to bilingual cognitive pressures, divergent change has usually been explained by appealing to sociocultural factors. We argue that the effects of social pressures on linguistic systems must nevertheless be realized in how language is processed in the individual bilingual speaker and, therefore, that divergent change is also ultimately rooted in bilingual cognition. Since lexical forms are most susceptible to contact-induced divergent change we focus on their production. We begin by developing a cognitive model that combines Grosjean's language mode with a later output-monitoring stage. The parameters to the model are then fit to the results of an experiment in which bilinguals are seen to avoid shared lexical items. These best-fit parameters form the basis of a series of multi-agent simulations that show rapid divergence in the lexica of languages with large proportions of bilinguals. We consider the implications of these findings for the psycholinguistic study of bilingual lexical selection, the construction of phylogenies, and the reconstruction of language family histories.},

  abstract = {This article is intended as a critical survey of the phonological theories of the syntaxphonology interface. These theories can be divided into two main groups, according to the role they attribute to syntactic representations in creating phonological domains. On the one hand there is the Direct Reference Theory, which claims that phonological operations are directly sensitive to syntactic information, in terms of relations of c-command or mcommand (i.e., government) holding between the elements participating in phonological processes. On the other, there is the Prosodic Hierarchy Theory of Prosodic Phonology, which defends the view that syntactic and phonological representations are not isomorphic and that there is a distinct level of representation called Prosodic Structure which contains a hierarchically organized set of prosodic constituents. These constituents are built from syntactic structure by a finite set of parameterized algorithms, and phonological processes refer to prosodic constituents rather than to syntactic constituents. Elordieta (1997, 1999) proposes that certain phonological phenomena may be specified to apply in the domains or constituents formed by functional and lexical heads related by feature checking. Seidl's (2001) Minimal Indirect Reference Theory claims that syntactic relationships such as theta-domains determine phonological constituency at the phrasal level. Another important, more recent view is the one that maintains that spellout domains (that is, all the material included in a syntactic phase except for the head of the phase and elements in the specifier of that phase) are interpreted as phonological constituents in PF.},

  abstract = {Causal analysis lies at the heart of moral judgment. For instance, a general assumption of most ethical theories is that people are only morally responsible for an outcome when their action causally contributed to it. Considering the causal relations between our acts and potential good and bad outcomes is also of crucial importance when we plan our future actions. Here, we investigate which aspects of causal relations are particularly influential when the moral permissibility of actions and the moral responsibility of agents for accidental harms are assessed. Causal strength and causal structure are two independent properties of causal models that may affect moral judgments. We investigated whether the length of a causal chain between acts and accidental harms, a structural feature of causal relations, affects people's moral evaluation of action and agent. In three studies (N = 2285), using a combination of vignettes and causal learning paradigms, we found that longer chains lead to more lenient moral evaluations of actions and agents. Moreover, we show that the reason for this finding is that harms are perceived to be less likely, and therefore less foreseeable for agents, when the relation is indirect rather than direct. When harms are considered equally likely and equally foreseeable, causal structure largely ceases to affect moral judgments. The findings demonstrate a tight coupling between causal representations, mental state in\- ferences, and moral judgments, and show that reasoners process and integrate these components in a largely rational manner.},

  abstract = {Scalar implicatures'' is a phrase used to refer to some inferences arising from the competition between alternatives: typically, ``Mary read some of the books'' ends up conveying that Mary did not read all books, because one could have said ``Mary read all books''. The so-called grammatical theory argues that these inferences obtain from the application of a covert operator exh, which not only has the capability to negate alternative sentences, but also the capability to be embedded within sentences under other linguistic operators, i.e. exh has the potential to add to the meaning of expressions (not necessarily full sentences), the negation of their alternatives. This view typically seeks support from the existence of readings that could not be explained without the extra-capability of exh to occur in embedded positions. However, if some embedded positions seem to be accessible to exh, not all conceivable positions that exh could occupy yield sensible results. In short: the exh approach is powerful, maybe too powerful. Various approaches based on logical strength and monotonicity have been proposed to justify on principled grounds the limited distribution of exh; these approaches are mostly based on a comparison between possible parses, and considerations of monotonicity (e.g., the Strongest Meaning Hypothesis). We propose a new constraint based instead on ``connectedness'', ruling out parses because of inherent problems their outcome may raise. Connectedness is a sister notion of monotonicity, which has been recruited to explain certain lexical restrictions on nouns, adjectives and more recently quantifiers; we propose here that connectedness could play a similar role at the level of propositional meanings.},

Internal reconstruction, informed by close resemblances among synchronically attested clause types, suggests that Hup's headless relative clause has given rise to a converb construction, a subtype of adverbial in which a dedicated verb form modifies a main clause. This development provides new insight into the origins of converbs and sheds light on the crosslinguistically common resemblance between relative and adverbial constructions more generally. Additionally, the Hup converbal clause has itself developed a main clause function, and the subordinating morphology employed by the relative and converb constructions is associated with topicalization. The transitions undergone by these structures in Hup contribute to our understanding of the diachronic pathways that may be taken by clauses once they have attained syntactic complexity.},

  abstract = {In conversation, interlocutors routinely indicate whether something said or done has been processed and integrated. Such feedback includes backchannels such as `okay' or `mhm', the production of a next relevant turn, and repair initiation via clarification requests. Importantly, such feedback can be produced not only at sentence/turn boundaries, but also sub-sententially. In this paper, we extend an existing model of incremental semantic processing in dialogue, based around the Dynamic Syntax (DS) grammar framework, to provide a low-level, integrated account of backchannels, clarification requests and their responses; demonstrating that they can be accounted for as part of the core semantic structure-building mechanisms of the grammar, rather than via higher level pragmatic phenomena such as intention recognition, or treatment as an ``unofficial'' part of the conversation. The end result is an incremental model in which words, not turns, are seen as procedures for contextual update and backchannels serve to align participant semantic processing contexts and thus ease the production and interpretation of subsequent conversational actions. We also show how clarification requests and their following responses and repair can be modelled within the same DS framework, wherein the divergence and re-alignment effort in participants' semantic processing drives conversations forward.},

  abstract = {The centrality of language in human life means we cannot document any language without understanding all the spheres of knowledge it is used to talk about. Equally, undocumented languages contain too much information to be wasted on linguists alone. As the medium through which the whole fabric of traditional knowledge about everything in the world is transmitted, the importance of these languages stretches out in the direction of many fields of enquiry, from ethnoecology to comparative jurisprudence to deep history to the study of musical and verbal art. Linguists, then, have a responsibility not just to their own field but to all areas of scholarship concerned with the almost infinite varieties of human creativity, and we abrogate this responsibility if we do not seek to follow our documentation of the languages we study down all these lanes and by ways of orally transmitted lore. One of the appeals of fieldwork is that we get the opportunity to develop interests in many new subjects, from botany through ethnography to thatch-making. But few linguists reach the point where we are able to really penetrate to the heart of all these fields, and in practice the best way to extend our documentary coverage is through some form of interdisciplinary fieldwork. The advantages of interdisciplinary fieldwork are most obvious in the way it can extend the detailed lexicon of targeted areas \textemdash{} botanical terms with the botanist, rock types with the geologist, terms for spear or personal adornment types with the material culture specialist, and so forth.},

  abstract = {This article uses instrumental data from natural speech to examine the phenomenon of pause placement within the verbal word in Dalabon, a polysynthetic Australian language of Arnhem Land. Though the phenomenon is incipient and in two sample texts occurs in only around 4\% of verbs, there are clear possibilities for interrupting the grammatical word by pause after the pronominal prefix and some associated material at the left edge, though these within-word pauses are significantly shorter, on average, than those between words. Within-word pause placement is not random, but is restricted to certain a\textperthousand x boundaries; it requires that the paused-after material be at least dimoraic, and that the remaining material in the verbal word be at least disyllabic. Bininj Gun-wok, another polysynthetic language closely related to Dalabon, does not allow pauses to interrupt the verbal word, and the Dalabon development appears to be tied up with certain morphological innovations that have increased the proportion of closed syllables in the pronominal prefix zone of the verb. Though only incipient and not yet phonologized, pause placement in Dalabon verbs suggests a phonologydriven route by which polysynthetic languages may ultimately become less morphologically complex by fracturing into smaller units.},

While this task is central to everyday communication, our knowledge of the cross-linguistic grammatical means that target such intersubjective coordination has remained basic. In two serialised papers, we introduce the term `engagement' to refer to grammaticalised means for encoding the relative mental directedness of speaker and addressee towards an entity or state of affairs, and describe examples of engagement systems from around the world. Engagement systems express the speaker's assumptions about the degree to which their attention or knowledge is shared (or not shared) by the addressee. Engagement categories can operate at the level of entities in the here-and-now (deixis), in the unfolding discourse (definiteness vs indefiniteness), entire event-depicting propositions (through markers with clausal scope), and even metapropositions (potentially scoping over evidential values). In this first paper, we introduce engagement and situate it with respect to existing work on intersubjectivity in language. We then explore the key role of deixis in coordinating attention and expressing engagement, moving through increasingly intercognitive deictic systems from those that focus on the the location of the speaker, to those that encode the attentional state of the addressee.},

In our first foray into engagement (Part 1), we focused on specialised semantic contrasts as found in entity-level deictic systems, tailored to the primal scenario for establishing joint attention. This second paper broadens out to an exploration of engagement at the level of events and even metapropositions, and comments on how such systems may evolve. The languages Andoke and Kogi demonstrate what a canonical system of engagement with clausal scope looks like, symmetrically assigning `knowing' and `unknowing' values to speaker and addressee. Engagement is also found cross-cutting other epistemic categories such as evidentiality, for example where a complex assessment of relative speaker and addressee awareness concerns the source of information rather than the proposition itself. Data from the language Abui reveal that one way in which engagement systems can develop is by upscoping demonstratives, which normally denote entities, to apply at the level of events. We conclude by stressing the need for studies that focus on what difference it makes, in terms of communicative behaviour, for intersubjective coordination to be managed by engagement systems as opposed to other, non-grammaticalised means.},

In fact, there are vanishingly few universals of language in the direct sense that all languages exhibit them. Instead, diversity can be found at almost every level of linguistic organization. This fundamentally changes the object of enquiry from a cognitive science perspective. This target article summarizes decades of cross-linguistic work by typologists and descriptive linguists, showing just how few and unprofound the universal characteristics of language are, once we honestly confront the diversity offered to us by the world's 6,000 to 8,000 languages. After surveying the various uses of ``universal,'' we illustrate the ways languages vary radically in sound, meaning, and syntactic organization, and then we examine in more detail the core grammatical machinery of recursion, constituency, and grammatical relations. Although there are significant recurrent patterns in organization, these are better explained as stable engineering solutions satisfying multiple design constraints, reflecting both cultural-historical factors and the constraints of human cognition.},

The empirical side of this paper discusses the correlations between Aktionsart and scale structure in the case of deverbal adjectives with the affix -ivo `-ive'. It is shown that there is initial plausibility that unbounded events translate as open scales, while bounded events become upper-closed scales. This supports a program of research where derivational affixes are transitioners from one domain to the other, and whose job is to adapt the notions found on the base to a language that is interpretable inside the new lexical category.},

Both nuclear and core SVCs in Standard Mandarin Chinese form via the nexus relation of cosubordination and they differ in terms of the argument structure formation. Assuming a two-level argument structure, it is argued that the nuclear SVCs form by fusing the semantic level of argument structure of component verbs, and the core SVCs form by partially fusing the syntactic level of argument structure of component verbs. Our analysis indicates that the nuclear SVCs, which function on par with a single predicate, constitute a type of complex predicates. Unlike the nuclear SVCs, core SVCs comprise two separate predicates, each owning a partially independent argument structure. In this sense, the core SVCs fall out of the category of complex predicates.},

Along this line of research, this paper describes the various uses of three focus particles in Italian (anche and pure `also', solo `only'). Besides their largely lexical function of selecting one item out of a set, they also show illocutive functions connected to the speech act domain (modification of the illocutionary force of an utterance and speech act specification in an interpersonal perspective). Investigating their meaning variation in different contexts, the suitability of the concept of reanalysis to describe the emergence of new uses is discussed as well as the role of discourse inferences in shaping them. Particular attention is paid to the first stages of reanalysis, using survey data to investigate the blurry boundary between the contextual emergence of new functions and the process of conventionalization.},

Using an experimental-semiotic task, we find that human communication systems evolve to be easier to use (production efficiency and reproduction fidelity), but harder to learn (identification accuracy) for a second generation of na\textasciidieresis\i ve participants. Thus, usability trumps learnability. In addition, the communication systems that evolve in larger populations exhibit distinct advantages over those that evolve in smaller populations: the learnability loss (from the Initial signs) is more muted and the usability benefits are more pronounced. The usability benefits for human communication systems that evolve in a small and large population is explained through guided variation reducing sign complexity. The enhanced performance of the communication systems that evolve in larger populations is explained by the operation of a content bias acting on the larger pool of competing signs. The content bias selects for information-efficient iconic signs that aid learnability and enhance usability.},

Here, we report two experiments that generate empirical evidence to inform gesture-first and vocal-first theories of language origin; in each, we tested modern humans' ability to communicate a range of meanings (995 distinct words) using either gesture or non-linguistic vocalization. Experiment 1 is a cross-cultural study, with signal Producers sampled from Australia (               n               = 30,               M               age               = 32.63, s.d. = 12.42) and Vanuatu (               n               = 30,               M               age               = 32.40, s.d. = 11.76). Experiment 2 is a cross-experiential study in which Producers were either sighted (               n               = 10,               M               age               = 39.60, s.d. = 11.18) or severely vision-impaired (               n               = 10,               M               age               = 39.40, s.d. = 10.37). A group of undergraduate student Interpreters guessed the meaning of the signals created by the Producers (               n               = 140). Communication success was substantially higher in the gesture modality than the vocal modality (twice as high overall; 61.17\% versus 29.04\% success). This was true within cultures, across cultures and even for the signals produced by severely vision-impaired participants. The success of gesture is attributed in part to its greater universality (i.e. similarity in form across different Producers). Our results support the hypothesis that gesture is the primary modality for language creation.},

Are these computations carried out by domain-general circuits or by circuits that store domainspecific representations? Recent work has characterized the roles in language comprehension of the language network, which is selective for high-level language processing, and the multiple-demand (MD) network, which has been implicated in executive functions and linked to fluid intelligence and thus is a prime candidate for implementing computations that support information processing across domains. The language network responds robustly to diverse aspects of comprehension, but the MD network shows no sensitivity to linguistic variables. We therefore argue that the MD network does not play a core role in language comprehension and that past findings suggesting the contrary are likely due to methodological artifacts. Although future studies may reveal some aspects of language comprehension that require the MD network, evidence to date suggests that those will not be related to core linguistic processes such as lexical access or composition. The finding that the circuits that store linguistic knowledge carry out computations on those representations aligns with general arguments against the separation of memory and computation in the mind and brain.},

  abstract = {Languages of the world display many structural similarities. We test the hypothesis that some of these structural properties may arise from biases operating during language acquisition that shape languages over time. Specifically, we investigate whether language learners are biased toward linguistic systems that strike an efficient balance between robust information transfer, on the one hand, and effort or resource demands, on the other hand, thereby increasing the communicative utility of the acquired language. In two experiments, we expose learners to miniature artificial languages designed in such a way that they do not use their formal devices (case marking) efficiently to facilitate robust information transfer. We find that learners restructure such languages in ways that facilitate efficient information transfer compared with the input language. These systematic changes introduced by the learners follow typologically frequent patterns, supporting the hypothesis that some of the structural similarities found in natural languages are shaped by biases toward communicatively efficient linguistic systems.},

The paper argues that despite certain similarities, the two sets of verbs in English and Persian have clear differences, both in terms of the syntactic structures in which they appear and their functions within the stories. Notably, beyond the expression of translational motion, aamadan and raftan encode aspect, subjectivity, and the speakers' perspectives on certain elements of the events as the stories unfold in their memories. Such choices in grammatical structures of the narratives can reveal much about the speakers' underlying cognitive processing and contribute to the understanding of the speakers' conceptual image of the story line.},

This paper highlights serious problems in this classic approach for dealing with skewed data. Despite the common belief that the log transformation can decrease the variability of data and make data conform more closely to the normal distribution, this is usually not the case. Moreover, the results of standard statistical tests performed on log-transformed data are often not relevant for the original, non-transformed data. We demonstrate these problems by presenting examples that use simulated data. We conclude that if used at all, data transformations must be applied very cautiously. We recommend that in most circumstances researchers abandon these traditional methods of dealing with skewed data and, instead, use newer analytic methods that are not dependent on the distribution the data, such as generalized estimating equations (GEE).},

In this article, we review the original argument for GE processing, and we present new evidence that supports the concept: first, local interpretations are computed, which can interfere with global ones; second, new findings based on the recording of event-related potentials show the use of simple heuristics rather than compositional algorithms for constructing sentence meaning; and recent studies show that the comprehension system has mechanisms for handling disfluencies, but they work imperfectly. We argue that the GE approach to language comprehension is similar to the use of fast and frugal heuristics for decision-making, and that future research should explore this connection more thoroughly.},

Prosodic phrasing clearly correlates to syntactic structure in both languages, but tonal excursions correspond to pitch accents plus boundaries in German, and have a demarcative function in French. This difference is explained by the presence vs. absence of lexical stresses in the two languages. It is reflected in the position of tones, which are peripheral in the French prosodic phrases, but are associated with metrical heads in German, and also with final lengthening, which is systematic in French, but not in German. A final difference between the two languages is deaccenting, used in German, but not in French.},

The financial paywall makes access to peer-reviewed research prohibitively expensive for many researchers. The psychological paywall refers to the gatekeeping nature of academic language. Elites hoard the products of scientific research and gatekeep membership in the specialist communities via arcane vocabulary and discourse structures, together with imposition of a tone that demands dispassionate engagement with topics that are urgent and painful to the participants of their research. To exclude the perspectives of those outside the ivory tower is to dismiss unique experiences and epistemologies, essentially blocking diversity of thought in linguistic science. A range of tools is needed to undermine this power structure. Here I highlight one, which is diverse media, in general, and podcasting, specifically. Podcasting brings diverse views into the conversation and allows racially offensive ideas to be understood as such so they can then be challenged. I present the case study of the putative so-called ``30-million-word gap''\textemdash the claim that, by the time they are four years old, historically marginalized children are exposed to thirty million fewer words than middle- and upper-class white children. I use this notion, which is preposterous on its face, to illustrate the emancipatory potential of the podcast medium.},

This challenge is exacerbated by considerable variability between and within speakers. Focusing on syntactic processing (parsing), we test the hypothesis that language comprehenders rapidly adapt to the syntactic statistics of novel linguistic environments (e.g., speakers or genres). Two self-paced reading experiments investigate changes in readers' syntactic expectations based on repeated exposure to sentences with temporary syntactic ambiguities (so-called ``garden path sentences''). These sentences typically lead to a clear expectation violation signature when the temporary ambiguity is resolved to an a priori less expected structure (e.g., based on the statistics of the lexical context). We find that comprehenders rapidly adapt their syntactic expectations to converge towards the local statistics of novel environments. Specifically, repeated exposure to a priori unexpected structures can reduce, and even completely undo, their processing disadvantage (Experiment 1). The opposite is also observed: a priori expected structures become less expected (even eliciting garden paths) in environments where they are hardly ever observed (Experiment 2). Our findings suggest that, when changes in syntactic statistics are to be expected (e.g., when entering a novel environment), comprehenders can rapidly adapt their expectations, thereby overcoming the processing disadvantage that mistaken expectations would otherwise cause. Our findings take a step towards unifying insights from research in expectation-based models of language processing, syntactic priming, and statistical learning.},

LVCs are complex predicates consisting of a semantically light verb and an eventive noun realized within a phrasal complement, e.g. German zur Vollendung kommen, lit. `come into completion'. We assume that (at least) two different processes interact in the emergence of LVCs: the desemanticization of the verb on the one hand and the realization of eventive nouns in the complement-PP of the verb on the other. In order to check whether these processes take place in parallel or if one precedes the other, we conduct a corpus study based on samples from the Reference Corpus of Middle High German (REM) and the Bonn Early New High German Corpus (FnhdC), focusing on the animacy and concreteness of the subject NPs and the PP-internal nouns. Our results indicate that we can first observe an increase in the use of abstract nouns in subject position and that only later \textendash{} from Middle High German to Early New High German \textendash{} eventive nouns in PP-internal position become more frequent.},

This epoch, according to the Anthropocene Working Group, began in the mid-20th century and reflects the ``great acceleration'' that began with industrialization in Europe [J. Zalasiewicz et al.,               Anthropocene               19, 55\textendash 60 (2017)]. Ironically, European ideals of protecting a pristine ``wilderness,'' free from the damaging role of humans, is still often heralded as the antidote to this human-induced crisis [J. E. M. Watson et al.,               Nature               , 563, 27\textendash 30 (2018)]. Despite decades of critical engagement by Indigenous and non-Indigenous observers, large international nongovernmental organizations, philanthropists, global institutions, and nation-states continue to uphold the notion of pristine landscapes as wilderness in conservation ideals and practices. In doing so, dominant global conservation policy and public perceptions still fail to recognize that Indigenous and local peoples have long valued, used, and shaped ``high-value'' biodiverse landscapes. Moreover, the exclusion of people from many of these places under the guise of wilderness protection has degraded their ecological condition and is hastening the demise of a number of highly valued systems. Rather than denying Indigenous and local peoples' agency, access rights, and knowledge in conserving their territories, we draw upon a series of case studies to argue that wilderness is an inappropriate and dehumanizing construct, and that Indigenous and community conservation areas must be legally recognized and supported to enable socially just, empowering, and sustainable conservation across scale.},

  abstract = {It is usually claimed that statement high rises in Australian English are more or less phonetically identical to yes/no question rises. In this paper, statement high rises and question rises were examined in a corpus of controlled spontaneous speech (i.e. map task dialogues) to see if this is the case. It appears that speakers in this study used different kinds of rises for declaratives and questions. The majority of statement high rises were realized with a low pitch accent onset, whereas almost all question rises were produced with high pitch accent onsets. High-range fall-rises also appeared to be used by some speakers in the same way as statement high rises. Implications of these findings for the current ToBI analysis of Australian English are considered.},

  abstract = {When people observe everyday activity, they spontaneously parse it into discrete meaningful events. Individuals who segment activity in a more normative fashion show better subsequent memory for the events. If segmenting events effectively leads to better memory, does asking people to attend to segmentation improve subsequent memory? To answer this question, participants viewed movies of naturalistic activity with instructions to remember the activity for a later test, and in some conditions additionally pressed a button to segment the movies into meaningful events or performed a control condition that required button-pressing but not attending to segmentation. In five experiments, memory for the movies was assessed at intervals ranging from immediately following viewing to one month later. Performing the event segmentation task led to superior memory at delays ranging from 10 min to one month. Further, individual differences in segmentation ability predicted individual differences in memory performance for up to a month following encoding. This study provides the first evidence that manipulating event segmentation affects memory over long delays and that individual differences in event segmentation are related to differences in memory over long delays. These effects suggest that attending to how an activity breaks down into meaningful events contributes to memory formation. Instructing people to more effectively segment events may serve as a potential intervention to alleviate everyday memory complaints in aging and clinical populations.},

I will argue that the main principle at work in the formation of the morphosyntax of pidgins is a general human capacity for language simplification, but that these processes of simplification are subject both to the effects of specific linguistic features in the local multilingual contact situation that gives rise to the pidgin and to constraints resulting from a universal linguistic endowment. By a comparative look across a range of morphosyntactic features at the processes of simplification that produced three unrelated pidgins of New Guinea, Yimas Pidgin, Hiri Motu and Tok Pisin, the article exemplifies some of the types of structures that can result in pidgins from this general human capacity for language simplification, sifted through both local conditions and universal constraints.},

  abstract = {This study focused on durational cues (i.e., syllable duration, pause duration, and syllable onset intervals (SOIs)) at discourse boundaries in two dialects of Mandarin,Taiwan and Mainland varieties. Speech was elicited by having 18 participants describe events in The Pear Story film. Recorded data were transcribed, labeled, and segmented into clauses. Discourse boundary indices were used to label discourse disjuncture levels. Results showed that the scope of lengthening included both the final and the penultimate syllables. Pause was a robust but optional indicator for discourse boundaries, and Taiwan Mandarin preferred unfilled over filled ones, while the Mainland variety did not show such strong preferences. Discourse hierarchy corresponded consistently with occurrences of pauses and duration of SOIs, within which pause was the main contributor. Higher discourse levels were more likely to be accompanied by pauses, and were indicated by longer pauses and SOIs. Syllable duration only played a secondary role in indicating discourse disjuncture size when pause was absent. When there was an accompanying pause, Mainland Mandarin relied solely on it to indicate discourse hierarchy, while Taiwan Mandarin used both syllable and pause duration, a dialectal difference that seemed to be rhythm-related. By shortening the degree of lengthening in the boundary syllable and lengthening the following pause at the same time,Taiwan Mandarin increased the absolute and relative duration of pause and maximized its role in indicating discourse hierarchy.The results of this study implied that the use of pause in discourse disjuncture demarcation was more of a language-specific choice while its role in discourse hierarchy encoding is more language-universal.},

It wasfound that there were increased R Ts at the ends compared with the beginnings of deep structure clauses. No difference was found between RTs at the beginnings and ends of surface clauses not corresponding to a deep clause. The results were interpreted as showing that deep clauses are major planning units and that some planning for clauses occurs at the end of the preceding clause. Differences were found between RTs during clauses of different syntactic structure. These results were interpreted as indicating that syntax influences production and were discussed in relation to previous studies of pausing and speech disruption.},

Sanzhi Dargwa is spoken by approximately 250 speakers and is severely endangered. This book is the first comprehensive descriptive grammar of Sanzhi, written from a typological perspective. It treats all major levels of grammar (phonology, morphology, syntax) and also information structure. Sanzhi Dargwa is structurally similar to other East Caucasian languages, in particular Dargwa languages. It has a relatively large consonant inventory including pharyngeal and ejective consonants. Sanzhi morphology is concatenative and mainly suffixing. The language exhibits a mixture of dependent-marking in the form of a rich case inventory and head-marking in the form of verbal agreement. Nouns are divided into three genders. Verbal inflection conflates tense/aspect/mood/evidentiality in a rich array of synthetic and analytic verb forms as well as participles, converbs, a masdar, and infinitive and some other forms used in analytic tenses and subordinate clauses. Salient traits of the grammar are two independently operating agreement systems: gender/number agreement and person agreement. Within the nominal domain, modifiers agree with the head nominal in gender/number. Agreement within the clausal domain is mainly controlled by the argument in the absolutive case. Person agreement operates only at the clausal level and according to the person hierarchy 1, 2 \&gt; 3. Sanzhi has ergative alignment in the form of gender/number agreement and ergative case marking. The most frequent word order at the clause level is APV, though all other logically possible word orders are also attested. In subordinate clauses, word order is almost exclusively head-final.},

The paper explores various semantic and social contexts in which the terms are differentially employed. Further discussed are lexical connections and semantic parallels with terms in other Malayo-Polynesian languages and the way these bear on the referents of Austronesian protoforms. Particular attention is given to Blust's reconstruction of *qa(R)(CtT)a (reflected by Nage ata) as a word hypothetically specifying `outsiders, alien people'. With reference to Nage and other languages of Flores, it is shown how, rather than a simple contrast of outsiders and own group, ata and hoga are employed to express a variety of kinds and degrees of association or disassociation between speaker and referent. In this connection further attention is given to: (1) the question of whether Nage terms for humans and compounds formed from these compose a taxonomy comparable to the taxonomic ordering of plants and animals commonly found in folk biological classifications, and (2) the relation between the terms denoting human beings and Nage categories translatable as `(non-human) animal' and `spiritual being'.},

  abstract = {The ability to selectively process information (attention) and to retain information in an accessible state (working memory) are critical aspects of our cognitive capacities. While there has been much work devoted to understanding attention and working memory, the nature of the relationship between these constructs is not well understood. Indeed, while neither attention nor working memory represent a uniform set of processes, theories of their relationship tend to focus on only some aspects. This review of the literature examines the role of perceptual and central attention in the encoding, maintenance, and manipulation of information in working memory. While attention and working memory were found to interact closely during encoding and manipulation, the evidence suggests a limited role of attention in the maintenance of information. Additionally, only central attention was found to be necessary for manipulating information in working memory. This suggests that theories should consider the multifaceted nature of attention and working memory. The review concludes with a model describing how attention and working memory interact.},

  abstract = {The Cantonese `coverb' construction, a serial verb construction in which the first verb (the `coverb') has a preposition-like meaning and function, presents a challenge for theories of wh-dependencies and island constraints. Coverbs resist extraction of their objects by topicalization or relativization, a fact which has often been explained in terms of a preposition-stranding constraint in accounts of similar facts in Mandarin. However, Cantonese coverbs display the morphosyntactic properties of verbs, suggesting that they cannot be prepositions. In this paper, we propose that coverbs are verbs, and that the relevant extraction constraint is a kind of adjunct island constraint. This proposal is supported with experimental evidence from a sentence judgment task. Two key findings are as follows: (1) listeners judged extraction from a coverb phrase as significantly less acceptable than extraction from a simple clause; (2) listeners judged sentences both with and without aspectual marking (verbal morphosyntax) on the coverb as highly acceptable. Together, these findings support our proposal that coverbs are verbs (not prepositions) and that coverb phrases form a kind of adjunct island. However, we show that existing adjunct island conditions (such as the CED) are not adequate to account for our data. Following Hawkins' (1999) processing-based theory of filler-gap dependencies, we propose a simple, languagespecific formulation of the extraction constraint, and we argue that this constraint is more generally motivated by a processing principle called Avoid Competing Subcategorizers \textendash{} one of the same principles that motivates preposition-stranding constraints in other languages. Thus, although object extraction is prohibited by a kind of adjunct island constraint, the function of the constraint in processing efficiency is similar to that of a preposition-stranding constraint.},

Although a clear case of verb serialization, such phrases reveal a strong asymmetry between their free verb head (V1), and what appears to be little more than a post-head modifier (V2). Because the resulting ``macro-verb'' can only refer to a single action, its internal structure has to obey strict rules; this paper analyses the way the valencies of both component verbs are capable of consistently merging into that of the whole macroverb, avoiding such things as conflicts between competing objects. Constraining though they may be, these syntactic rules turn out to be a powerful tool serving the speaker's creativity: indeed, this paradoxical ``chained freedom'' brings about spectacular paths of evolution in the history of Mwotlap macro-verb strategies.},

This theoretical problem is addressed here with respect to a typologically unusual phoneme in Hiw, an endangered Oceanic language of Vanuatu. This complex segment, /                              /, combines a velar voiced stop and a velar lateral approximant.

Seventeen distinct languages are spoken in the northernmost islands of Vanuatu. These closely related Oceanic languages have evolved from an earlier dialect network, by progressive diversification. Innovations affecting word forms \textemdash{} mostly sound change and lexical replacement \textemdash{} have usually spread only short distances across the network; their accumulation over time has resulted in linguistic fragmentation, as each spatially-anchored community developed its own distinctive vocabulary. However, while languages follow a strong tendency to diverge in the form of their words, they also exhibit a high degree of isomorphism in their linguistic structures, and in the organization of their grammars and lexicons. This structural homogeneity, typically manifested by the perfect translatability of constructions across languages, reflects the traditions of mutual contact and multilingualism which these small communities have followed throughout their history. While word forms are perceived as emblematic of place and diffuse to smaller social circles, linguistic structures are left free to diffuse across much broader networks. Ultimately, the effects of divergence and convergence are the end result, over time, of these two distinct forms of horizontal diffusion.},

Focusing on Hiw, an Oceanic language of northern Vanuatu, I show that lexical flexibility is there mostly due to the high multifunctionality of its word classes, each of which can regularly access a broad array of syntactic functions. Conversely, Hiw ranks relatively low on the scale of multicategoriality: most of its lexemes are assigned just one word class. This is how a language can be grammatically flexible, yet lexically rigid.},

  abstract = {The Engan Family of languages includes a number of languages and dialects that are part of the Trans New Guinea Phylum (TNGP) languages, a subgroup of the large and tentative group referred to as 'Papuan' languages. Such languages generally have a system of free pronominal forms which occur in cross-reference with fused verb suffixes. I examine the free forms in particular and draw attention to the reflexes and retentions of old endings in present day pronouns. I then attempt to reconstruct the basic forms and their endings for Proto-Engan. Because the evidence for sets of old endings goes beyond their use in Engan, I examine a number of languages which are located adjacent to the family as well. Finally, I briefly give evidence that there are other endings reflected in Papuan languages that are found on word classes other than pronouns.},

This study evaluated the suitability of such `home-made' recordings for phonetic analysis of vowel space configurations, mergers, and nasalization by comparing simultaneous recordings from several popular personal devices (Macbook, PC laptop, iPad, iPhone and Android smartphone) to those taken from professional equipment (H4n field recorder, Focusrite with Audio Technica 2021 microphone). All personal devices conveyed vowel arrangements and nasalization patterns relatively faithfully (especially laptops), but absolute measurements varied, particularly for the female speaker and in the 750\textendash 1500 Hz range, which affected the locations (F1 \texttimes{} F2) of low and back vowels and reduced nasalization measurements (A1-P0) for the female's pre-nasal vowels. Based on these results, we assess the validity of remote recording using these consumer devices and offer recommendations for best practices for collecting high fidelity acoustic phonetic data from a distance.},

However, the issue whether there is any relationship among the different kinds of prosodic marking remains unclear. This paper presents a detailed examination of the prosody of focus in European Portuguese. It is shown that there are no phrasing effects of focus; by contrast, phrasal stress and tonal events play a crucial role in the expression of focus. Implications of these findings for a cross-linguistic understanding of focus prosody are explored, namely it is argued that the prosodic reflexes are not universal, or arbitrary.},

Second-year students (n = 219; Female = 40) undertaking three semester-long courses in English as a foreign language participated in the year-long study. The structural model tested included prior achievement and self-concept (Time-1; 15 weeks prior), the motivational deficits for studying in the course (Time-2; ability, effort and task value), and class attendance across the two semesters of study. Self-concept negatively predicted all motivational deficits (moderate-large effects), and positively predicted attendance. Two of the motivational deficits (ability and effort) also had strongly contrasting effects (positive and negative respectively) on attendance. The implications and practical suggestions for intervention are discussed.},

This article illustrates a procedure for annotating evaluative expressions in text that facilitates more transparent, reliable and replicable analyses. The method is demonstrated through a case study analysis of APPRAISAL (Martin and White, 2005) in a small-size specialised corpus of CEO letters published by the British energy company, BP, and four competitors before and after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010. Drawing on Fuoli and Paradis's (2014) model of trust\textendash repair discourse, we examine how ATTITUDE and ENGAGEMENT resources are strategically deployed by BP's CEO in the attempt to repair stakeholders' trust after the accident.},

We examined whether the modality (visual or linguistic) with which speakers share information with their conversational partners results in memory traces that affect subsequent references addressed to a particular partner. In 32 triads, directors arranged a set of tangram cards with one matcher and then with another, but in different modalities, sharing some cards only linguistically (by describing cards the matcher couldn't see), some only visually (by silently showing them), some both linguistically and visually, and others not at all. Then directors arranged the cards again in separate rounds with each matcher. The modality with which they previously established common ground about a particular card with a particular matcher (e.g., linguistically with one partner and visually with the other) affected subsequent referring: References to cards previously shared only visually included more idea units, words, and reconceptualizations than those shared only linguistically, which in turn included more idea units, words, and reconceptualizations than those shared both linguistically and visually. Moreover, speakers were able to tailor references to the same card appropriately to the distinct modality shared with each addressee. Such gradient, partner-specific adaptation during re-referring suggests that memory encodes rich-enough rep\- resentations of multimodal shared experiences to effectively cue relevant constraints about the perceptual conditions under which speakers and addressees establish common ground.},

  abstract = {Core-periphery structure, the arrangement of a network into a dense core and sparse periphery, is a versatile descriptor of various social, biological, and technological networks. In practice, different core-periphery algorithms are often applied interchangeably, despite the fact that they can yield inconsistent descriptions of core-periphery structure. For example, two of the most widely used algorithms, the k-cores decomposition and the classic two-block model of Borgatti and Everett, extract fundamentally different structures: the latter partitions a network into a binary hub-and-spoke layout, while the former divides it into a layered hierarchy. We introduce a core-periphery typology to clarify these differences, along with Bayesian stochastic block modeling techniques to classify networks in accordance with this typology. Empirically, we find a rich diversity of core-periphery structure among networks. Through a detailed case study, we demonstrate the importance of acknowledging this diversity and situating networks within the core-periphery typology when conducting domain-specific analyses.},

Proto-Tamang was a two-tone language with three series of plosives and two series of continuants. The merger of its continuants provoked a split of the original two tones into four, two high and two low, which combine pitch and phonation features. The quasi-merger of the voiced and voiceless plosives left sporadic remnants of initial plosive voicing in low tone syllables. A previous production study has shown that speakers use pitch and phonation features concomitantly to distinguish high from low tones, while producing initial plosive voicing only marginally with low tones. The present perception study establishes the preeminence of the pitch cue, but also confirms the effective use of the two older cues in tone identification. An apparent-time analysis shows the phonation cue to be less used by younger speakers, in keeping with the historical evolution. The use of the residual voicing of plosives, instead of decreasing with younger speakers, is shown to increase. This result could be explained by an increased contact of the young generation with Nepali, a toneless Indo-Aryan language with a four-way initial plosive contrast.},

The data was collected using the fieldwork methods, color list and color-naming tasks. The rainbow order of colors does not affect the list task results. The results, i.e. basic color terms, are calculated according to the procedure in Davies \& Corbett. There are nine basic color terms in Mandarin. Ranked according to the cognitive salience criterion they are the following: h\'ong `red', hu\'ang `yellow', lu `green', l\'an `blue', h\=ei `black', b\'ai `white', z\v{i} `purple', f\v{e}n `pink', and hu\=i `gray'. Of the fully developed set of BCTs only the terms for `brown' and `orange' are absent. There are no real gender differences for the BCTs. Mandarin is a Stage VII basic color vocabulary language. The absence of the Stage VI term for `brown' is explained using the wild-card theory. As a result Mandarin is not a counter-example to the theory of basic color terms. We suggest that the term ch\'eng `orange' is the next candidate for basic status in Mandarin. There are two competing terms for basic `brown' z\=ong and h\`e. If one competing term for `brown' (with high probability the term z\=ong) becomes basic, Mandarin Chinese will have a full set (eleven) of basic color terms.},

Language policy initiated by state institutions, the development of literacy and new specialist registers of language are typical elements involved in the Ausbau process. However, the linguistic ideologies of small language groups such as those of the minority languages of Aboriginal Australia can drive certain forms of deliberate language elaboration. An important aspect of Aboriginal linguistic ideology is language diversity, reflected in the development of elemental sociolinguistic varieties such as patriclan lects. In the Bininj Kun-wok dialect chain of western Arnhem Land, a regional system of lectal di\textcurrency erentiation known as Kun-dangwok has developed, reflecting an Aboriginal linguistic ideology whereby being di\textcurrency erent, especially di\textcurrency erent ways of speaking, are seen as central aspects of identity. The functions of the Kun-dangwok clan lect system are described using examples of naturally occurring conversation which provide evidence that clan lects are the result of an Ausbau process that results in the opposite of language standardization and an increase in Abstand between varieties.},

This suggests that word-initial glottalization may arise from prosodic strengthening \textendash{} the phenomenon by which sounds are more `strongly' articulated in stronger prosodic positions. However, if wordinitial glottalization is due to prosodic strengthening, what exactly is being strengthened? The goal of this study is to determine whether voice quality is strengthened in vowels and sonorants, and whether this type of strengthening is consistent with word-initial glottalization. Prominent and/or phrase-initial voicing in English and Spanish was analyzed articulatorily using electroglottography. The results reveal that voicing during word-initial vowels in English and Spanish has increased contact under prominence, but not at phrasal onsets. Nonprominent initial vowels and sonorants are characterized by a decrease in contact, which I argue is inconsistent with both word-initial glottalization and voice quality strengthening. Based on the results, a prominence-driven account of word-initial glottalization is proposed and motivated.},

We will argue that a collective turn to Open Science holds great promise for phonetics. First, simple reflections on why access to primary data matters are recapitulated and proposed as a basis for consensus. Next, possible drawbacks of data availability are addressed. Finally, we argue that data curation and archiving are to be recognized as part of the same activity that results in the publication of research papers, rather than attempting to build a parallel system to incentivize data archiving by itself.},

  abstract = {Culture presents a second inheritance system by which innovations can be transmitted between generations and among individuals. Some vocal behaviours present compelling examples of cultural evolution. Where modifications accumulate over time, such a process can become cumulative cultural evolution. The existence of cumulative cultural evolution in non-human animals is controversial. When physical products of such a process do not exist, modifications may not be clearly visible over time. Here, we investigate whether the constantly evolving songs of humpback whales (               Megaptera novaeangliae               ) are indicative of cumulative cultural evolution. Using nine years of song data recorded from the New Caledonian humpback whale population, we quantified song evolution and complexity, and formally evaluated this process in light of criteria for cumulative cultural evolution. Song accumulates changes shown by an increase in complexity, but this process is punctuated by rapid loss of song material. While such changes tentatively satisfy the core criteria for cumulative cultural evolution, this claim hinges on the assumption that novel songs are preferred by females. While parsimonious, until such time as studies can link fitness benefits (reproductive success) to individual singers, any claims that humpback whale song evolution represents a form of cumulative cultural evolution may remain open to interpretation.

This paper discusses the author's experiences conducting fieldwork on the Wamesa language in West Papua, Indonesia under the auspices of a regional language center. The two groups with a stake in this research, the language center and the Wamesa speech community, both determined that their best interest were served by allowing open access to outside researchers and by encouraging wide dissemination of data. Their motivations for taking this view, and therefore the most appropriate ways for a linguist to reciprocate their support, varied greatly: the language center requested training in linguistic best practices, while the speech community felt they were receiving less tangible benefits, drawing on the prestige brought by the presence of an outsider and their religious attitudes towards language ownership. This account provides another possible model for the community/linguist relationship in which the community uses their control over research to expand rather than restrict access, and the outcome of acting ethically is significantly different than that described in some other well-publicized field sites.},

  abstract = {Classifications of evidentiality all include at least one `reported', `quotative' or `hearsay' category. This category is found in many language groups that are attested to have evidentiality, including the TibetoBurman family. Although attested, reported evidentiality is often under-described in both descriptive grammars of specific languages, and typologies of evidentiality across the family. This survey of reported evidentiality in the Tibeto-Burman family found mention of reported evidentiality in descriptions of 88 of 130 languages. While there are clear patterns with regards to the morphosyntactic features of reported evidentiality across these languages, there is a great deal of variation in the semantic features, including the number of reported evidential distinctions and the specificity of source. This survey demonstrates that reported evidentiality is complex and varied across languages, even within the same family, and outlines ways to improve future documentation and description.},

The data come from a set of interview narratives about people's experiences of the 2015 earthquakes in Nepal. The analysis begins with an examination of the relationship between reported speech, overt subjects and ergativity. We also look at reported speech and evidentiality, including grammatical reported speech evidentials. Structural features discussed include hybrid reported speech and multiple clause relationality. Interactional features discussed include the use of deictic shift, prominent subordination, and the multiple functions of reported speech forms, as well as zero-marked reported speech events. This analysis highlights the benefits of studying linguistic features such as reported speech in narrative context. We conclude with the implications of this usage-based analysis in the coverage of reported speech in descriptive grammars.},

  abstract = {A traditional concern of grammarians has been the question of whether the members of given pairs of expressions belong to the same or different syntactic categories. Consider the following example sentences. (               a               ) I think               Fido destroyed the kennel               . (               b               ) The kennel, I think               Fido destroyed               . Are the two underlined expressions members of the same syntactic category or not? The generative grammarians of the last quarter century have, almost without exception, taken the answer to be affirmative. In the present paper I explore the implications of taking the answer to be negative. The changes consequent upon this negative answer turn out to be very far-reaching: (i) it becomes as simple to state rules for constructions of the general type exemplified in (               b               ) as it is for the canonical NP VP construction in (               a               ); (ii) we immediately derive an explanation for a range of coordination facts that have remained quite mysterious since they were discovered by J. R. Ross some 15 years ago; (iii) our grammars can entirely dispense with the class of rules known as transformations; (iv) our grammars can be shown to be formally equivalent to what are known as the context-free phrase structure grammars; (v) this latter consequence has the effect of making potentially relevant to natural language grammars a whole literature of mathematical results on the parsability and learnability of context-free phrase structure grammars.},

Established by an influx of migrants from many dialect regions beginning in 1959, this presents a unique opportunity to study koin\'eization, new dialect formation, in progress. Trudgill's model predicts that a new dialect should largely emerge in the second generation born in the new region, exhibiting both simplification, the failure of marked variants to transmit across generations, and focusing, the selection of particular variants as a new norm for the community's new variety.Data from seventy-three sociolinguistic interviews was coded for phonological and lexical variables known to differ across Tibetan-speaking regions, and NeighborNets were constructed in SplitsTree. Results indicate that regionally marked variables were not transmitted into the first or second generation of Diaspora-raised speakers, but Diaspora speakers exhibited a high degree of variation comparable to that of speakers from the numerically- and socially-dominant U-Tsang region. That younger speakers have not yet converged on a single new variety suggests a role for additional factors to affect the rate of koin\'eization.},

In Dolakh\=a Newar adverbial and ``participial'' clauses are not syntactically distinct, but neither are they subordinate. I propose that the term ``converb'' be redefined as a clause-linkage strategy that subsumes adverbial clauses and clauses akin to the Dolakh\=ae ``participial'', and that there be no requirement that converbs be either subordinate or adverbial. I provide an analysis of ``case prolepsis'', the casemarking of an argument by a verb in a non-adjacent clause, and argue that this results from the participial construction applying at a distinct level of clause structure.},

This results from the recursive interaction of two basic combinatorial structures: chaining and embedding. While these structures are basic to many of the world's languages, in Dolakha Newar speakers combine them freely and frequently to spontaneously create sentences of remarkable intricacy. Additional structural nuance is provided by the chaining of constituents at levels below the clause and the sharing of core arguments. The result is a syntactic fabric of depth and complexity.},

Both direction and associated motion can be encoded by a range of grammatical strategies, including affixes, clitics, particles, serial-verb constructions, and auxiliary verbs. While some languages have only associated motion or direction, others have both, either via distinct subsystems, syntactic ambiguity, or context-dependent interpretation. While directional encodings can be interpreted as associated motion in some contexts, the reverse can also be true. Verbal semantics is key to the pragmatic interpretation of examples in context; some types of motion verbs are more compatible with directional interpretations and others with associated motion. In addition, certain types of motion verbs were found to be compatible with different temporal relationships that hold between the activity of the primary verb and the motional component. Finally, the grammatical role of the figure in such constructions depends on both the temporal relationship and the semantics of the verb.},

Almost every Yi language exhibits a set of minimal pairs, called simplex-complex pairs, of the following sort. The simplex member is an adjective or verb starting with a voiced consonant (e.g. ve33 'sway'). The complex member is derived from the former by devoicing the initial consonant and by augmenting its valency or adding causative meaning to it (e.g./e33 'wave = cause to sway*). Previous authors have treated this kind of data as a blind process of sound change and were undecided on the type of linguistic change, i.e. whether it represents a kind of grammaticalization or lexicalization. With pan-Yi data and statistical figures it is demonstrated that the sound changes constitute a phonetically and semantically motivated process of lexicalization.},

Only sortal verb classifiers in Sinitic, Tai-Kadai, Miao-Yao (not Tibeto-Burman) are classificatory in the combinatorial sense. Sortal verb classifiers stand for a lexical classification technique in which the classifiers are derived from adjunct noun phrases. Cross-linguistically, the technique contrasts with other techniques such as the classification of verbs by incorporated core arguments found in Native American languages. This paper also evaluates mensural verb classifiers and auto-classifiers which are generally not classificatory in the combinatorial sense.},

  abstract = {This study was motivated by the prospective role played by brain rhythms in speech perception. The intelligibility \textendash{} in terms of word error rate \textendash{} of naturalsounding, synthetically generated sentences was measured using a paradigm that alters speech-energy rhythm over a range of frequencies. The material comprised 96 semantically unpredictable sentences, each approximately 2 s long (6\textendash 8 words per sentence), generated by a high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis engine. The TTS waveform was time-compressed by a factor of 3, creating a signal with a syllable rhythm three times faster than the original, and whose intelligibility is poor ({$<$}50\% words correct). A waveform with an artificial rhythm was produced by automatically segmenting the time-compressed waveform into consecutive 40-ms fragments, each followed by a silent interval. The parameters varied were the length of the silent interval (0\textendash 160 ms) and whether the lengths of silence were equal (`periodic') or not (`aperiodic'). The performance curve (word error rate as a function of mean duration of silence) was U-shaped. The lowest word error rate (i.e., highest intelligibility) occurred when the silence was 80 ms long and inserted periodically. This is also the condition for which word error rate increased when the silence was inserted aperiodically. These data are consistent with a model (TEMPO) in which low-frequency brain rhythms affect the ability to decode the speech signal. In TEMPO, optimum intelligibility is achieved when the syllable rhythm is within the range of the high theta-frequency brain rhythms (6\textendash 12 Hz), comparable to the rate at which segments and syllables are articulated in conversational speech.},

Drawing on a corpus of examples gathered from natural speech, written texts, and television scripts, we show that CR restricts the interpretation of the copied element to a `real' or prototypical reading. Turning to the structural properties of the construction, we show that CR is unusual among reduplication phenomena in that whole idioms can be copied, object pronouns are often copied (as in the second example above), and inflectional morphology need not be copied. Thus the `scope' of CR cannot be defined in purely phonological terms; rather, a combination of phonological, morphosyntactic, syntactic, and lexical factors is involved. We develop an analysis within the parallel architecture framework of Jackendoff (1997, 2002), whereby CR is treated as a lexical item with syntactic and semantic content and reduplicative phonology. We then sketch an alternative analysis, based on current assumptions within the Minimalist Program, which involves movement into a focus-like position with both the head and the tail of the resulting chain spelled out.},

The frequent emergence of Tense-Aspect-Mood (TAM) markers from deictic motion verbs in particular, has also been extensively detailed in the literature. This paper focusses on the less well-known link between associated motion, a category of functional morphemes expressing (deictic) motion events, and TAM, in a language contact situation. Specifically, it provides a synchronic and diachronic description of three associated motion prefixes, joo-, t\'o\'o- and koo-, found in the Tanzanian Bantu language Rangi, spoken in an area of high linguistic diversity. It proposes that the prefix joo- encodes movement towards a deictic centre, t\'o\'o- encodes movement towards a goal which is not the deictic centre, and koo- encodes movement away from a deictic centre. It further contends that while t\'o\'o- and koo- have maintained a purely deictic function, joohas grammaticalised to assume an additional function whereby it encodes future tense, possibly aided by the absence of a dedicated future tense marker in the language. This three-way morphological encoding of spatial relations on the verb form is not a common characteristic of East African Bantu languages. However, this paper proposes that the system in Rangi can be accounted for on the basis of cross-linguistically widely attested pathways of grammatical change.},

The latter are, however, potentially subject to diachronic lexicalization, which may moreover involve the adoption of fore-stress. Hence, lexical NNs may be fore-stressed or end-stressed while phrasal NNs must be end-stressed. Although further potential sources of irregularity are identified, it is demonstrated that the model's predictive power is fairly robust and that, where it fails to predict firm stress patterns, it predicts their variability.},

The paper focuses on repeats where an interactant (partially) repeats their interlocutor's preceding utterance. Repeats are argued to provide affordances for the transmission of innovative and conservative linguistic items by forcing interactants to repeat linguistic material uttered by another person, facilitating production by exploiting priming effects. Moreover, repeats leave room for modification and thereby for actively resisting transmission. In this way, repeats unite the competing forces (Tantucci et al. 2018) of automaticity and creativity. To support this claim, this paper investigates the use of Spanish insertions and alternative variants in utterance-repeat pairs in Yurakar\'e (isolate, Bolivia) conversations. The findings are compatible with a holistic view of language where all linguistic levels are interconnected (Beckner et al. 2009).},

I argue that the development of will as a future tense marker in English involves the development of a new construction where two separate syntactic items are associated with a single event in the semantics. I also look at the loss of the impersonal construction in English, where it has been argued that the change is driven by an increase in the s\-chematicity of the Transitive Construction, as well as having been argued that dative experiencers have been reclassified as subjects. I observe that it has also been noted that dative experiencers could function as subjects in ea\- rlier varieties of English, and suggest that this is an example of category strengthening.},

Force dynamic roles differ from traditional roles in that their number is limited to two, they are not found only within word meanings, and they can link to participants outside the sentence. We examine evidence that they play a role in both causation and modality, and provide an argument that while ditransitives involve a result or purpose relation, they should not be analysed as prototypically causative, as they involve variable force-dynamic transfer. The conclusion is that not only do events cause events, but also participants act on participants.},

It is argued that using lexical universals as a vocabulary for semantic analysis allows one to formulate meaning descriptions that are rigorous, cognitively authentic, maximally translatable, and free from Anglocentrism. A second goal is to shed light on methodological issues in semantic fieldwork by interrogating some controversial claims about the Dalabon and Pirah\~a languages. We argue that reductive paraphrase into lexical universals provides a practical procedure for arriving at coherent interpretations of unfamiliar lexical meanings. Other indigenous/endangered languages discussed include East Cree, Arrernte, Kayardild, Karuk, and Maori. We urge field linguists to take the NSM metalanguage, based on lexical universals, into the field with them, both as an aid to lexicogrammatical documentation and analysis and as a way to improve semantic communication with consultants.},

To acquire relational terms such as run, walk, in, and on, infants must first perceive and conceptualize components of dynamic events such as containment\textendash support, path\textendash manner, source\textendash goal, and figure\textendash ground. Infants must then uncover how the particular language they are learning encodes these constructs. This review addresses the interaction of language learning with infants' conceptualization of these nonlinguistic spatial event components. We present the thesis that infants start with language-general nonlinguistic constructs that are gradually refined and tuned to the requirements of their native language. In effect, infants are trading spaces, maintaining their sensitivity to some relational distinctions while dampening other distinctions, depending on how their native language expresses these constructs.},

Yet native speakers also implicitly know when a creative and easily interpretable formulation-such as "Explain me this" or "She considered to go"-doesn't sound quite right. In this incisive book, Adele Goldberg explores how these creative but constrained language skills emerge from a combination of general cognitive mechanisms and experience.Shedding critical light on an enduring linguistic paradox, Goldberg demonstrates how words and abstract constructions are generalized and constrained in the same ways. When learning language, we record partially abstracted tokens of language within the high-dimensional conceptual space that is used when we speak or listen. Our implicit knowledge of language includes dimensions related to form, function, and social context. At the same time, abstract memory traces of linguistic usage-events cluster together on a subset of dimensions, with overlapping aspects strengthened via repetition. In this way, dynamic categories that correspond to words and abstract constructions emerge from partially overlapping memory traces, and as a result, distinct words and constructions compete with one another each time we select them to express our intended messages.While much of the research on this puzzle has favored semantic or functional explanations over statistical ones, Goldberg's approach stresses that both the functional and statistical aspects of constructions emerge from the same learning mechanisms},

  abstract = {General correlations between form and meaning at the level of argument structure patterns have often been assumed to be innate. Claims of innateness typically rest on the idea that the input is not rich enough for general learning strategies to yield the required representations. The present work demonstrates that the semantics associated with argument structure generalizations can indeed be learned, given the nature of the input and an understanding of general categorization strategies. Examination of an extensive corpus study of children's and mothers' speech shows that tokens of one particular verb are found to account for the lion's share of instances of each argument frame considered. Experimental results are reported that demonstrate that high token frequency of a single prototypical exemplar facilitates the learning of constructional meaning.},

While articulation rate proved to be a personality constant of remarkable invariance it also reflects the degree of spontaneity in the production of speech. Variations in level of verbal planning were shown to have no effect on the rate of articulation. The implications of these results are discussed.},

The only necessary though not sufficient condition for the appearance of temporal rhythm was that at least 30\% of utterance time be pausing time. Readings and translations as well as spontaneous speech were capable of exhibiting a rhythmic structure when fulfilling this condition. The relative pausing time in the periods of high fluency seemed an additional factor in the occurrence of this rhythm. The implications of these results are discussed.},

The material investigated covered a wide field of speech productions, of different speakers and different speech tasks. Their analysis showed that the hierarchy of syntactic structures is reflected differentially in the pause structure of spontaneous speech. When readings of the spontaneous texts were compared with the original spontaneous speech it emerged that the reading process modifies the pausing for different syntactic structures differently. Sentences as distinct from clauses are marked by their temporal cohesion in spontaneous speech as well as in reading. This fact is discussed with reference to Wundt's analytical theory of sentence-wholes.},

  abstract = {Morphological tasks use large multi-lingual datasets that organize words into inflection tables, which then serve as training and evaluation data for various tasks. However, a closer inspection of these data reveals profound cross-linguistic inconsistencies, that arise from the lack of a clear linguistic and operational definition of what is a word, and that severely impair the universality of the derived tasks. To overcome this deficiency, we propose to view morphology as a clauselevel phenomenon, rather than word-level. It is anchored in a fixed yet inclusive set of features homogeneous across languages, that encapsulates all functions realized in a saturated clause. We deliver MIGHTYMORPH, a novel dataset for clause-level morphology covering 4 typologically-different languages: English, German, Turkish and Hebrew. We use this dataset to derive 3 clause-level morphological tasks: inflection, reinflection and analysis. Our experiments show that the clause-level tasks are substantially harder than the respective word-level tasks, while having comparable complexity across languages. Furthermore, redefining morphology to the clause-level provides a neat interface with contextualized language models (LMs) and can be used to probe LMs capacity to encode complex morphology. Taken together, this work opens up new horizons in the study of computational morphology, leaving ample space for studying neural morphological modeling cross-linguistically.},

Here, we consider four major forced aligners used in sociophonetics today: MAUS, FAVE, LaBB-CAT and MFA. Through comparisons with human coders, we find that both aligner and phonological context affect the quality of automated alignments of vowels extracted from English sociolinguistic interview data. MFA and LaBB-CAT produce the highest quality alignments, in some cases not significantly different from human alignment, followed by FAVE, and then MAUS. Aligners are less accurate placing boundaries following a vowel than preceding it, and they vary in accuracy across manner of articulation, particularly for following boundaries. These observations allow us to make specific recommendations for manual correction of forced alignment.},

Moreover, in many countries, research involving human subjects has become the target of increasing scrutiny, and the rise of digital means of information dissemination that has made contemporary documentary linguistics possible has foregrounded issues of rights and access to language resources. These contexts of ``culture clash'' have prompted serious considerations of ethical practices in documentation and revitalization. This chapter looks at these issues through the examination of five case studies which clarify the ideological underpinnings of key ethical concerns in language documentation and revitalization. Insights from the previous literature are incorporated into the discussion, and additional topics such as archiving and compliance with institutional regulations are also discussed.},

It is shown that the suffix is associated with a range of root-modal readings, with some variability in modal force. The modal readings are investigated in a variety of non-upward-entailing environments and compared with those of other variable modal force languages as described in the literature. I suggest that the purposive suffix does not behave in the same way as in these languages, which suggests that the typology of variable force modality is not uniform. I conclude by suggesting a connection to the modality described in non-finite and nominalised environments in a number of other languages.},

  abstract = {This paper explores morphologically-conditioned alternations in Mbat (Jarawan Bantu) verb stems. Some inflectional affixation in Mbat results in resyllabification. The singleton coda of a CGVC verb stem will become the onset of a new syllable following the addition of a vowel-initial suffix (e.g., Perfective -am). What is surprising is that this, in turn, triggers onset simplification in the stem itself (i.e., CV.C-am). Adding further complexity to Mbat is that these alternations are limited to verb stems containing mid vowels. Stems with low vowels retain their pre-vocalic glide upon suffixation (i.e., CGV.C-am). These outcomes have implications for at least two contemporary lines of inquiry in phonological theory: i) the prosodification and behavior of pre-vocalic glides, and ii) the formal connection between so-called M2 syllable margin positions (i.e., the second member of a complex onset and the sole member of a singleton coda). I illustrate that Mbat has something to contribute to current perspectives on both these fronts. In addition to the theoretical and typological contributions entailed herein, this paper is also significant in that it is the first formal linguistic study of a Jarawan Bantu language, a cluster of languages spoken primarily in eastern Nigeria.},

This relationship was hypothesized to be attenuated, however, when the structure of the discourse (as opposed t o the content) has been prepared in advance. The first prediction was borne out in Experiment 1 in that fwe of seven ideational boundaries were found to be associated with a decrease in speech fluency (at p {$<$} 0.10). Experiment 2 showed that this relationship was, indeed, attenuated under conditions of structural preparation in advance of speech.},

Our experiments show a 36.4\% F1 absolute improvement for French over an n-gram surface statistics baseline, currently the predominant method for MWE identification. Our models are useful for several NLP tasks in which MWE pre-grouping has improved accuracy.},

Our analyses of lexical data supported a pulse-pause scenario of Pacific settlement in which the Austronesian speakers originated in Taiwan around 5,200 years ago and rapidly spread through the Pacific in a series of expansion pulses and settlement pauses. We claimed that there was high congruence between traditional language subgroups and those observed in the language phylogenies, and that the estimated age of the Austronesian expansion at 5,200 years ago was consistent with the archaeological evidence. However, the congruence between the language phylogenies and the evidence from historical linguistics was not quantitatively assessed using tree comparison metrics. The robustness of the divergence time estimates to different calibration points was also not investigated exhaustively. Here we address these limitations by using a systematic tree comparison metric to calculate the similarity between the Bayesian phylogenetic trees and the subgroups proposed by historical linguistics, and by re-estimating the age of the Austronesian expansion using only the most robust calibrations. The results show that the Austronesian language phylogenies are highly congruent with the traditional subgroupings, and the date estimates are robust even when calculated using a restricted set of historical calibrations.},

One key dynamic is the rate of language change. While it is commonly thought that the rapid rate of change hampers the reconstruction of deep language relationships beyond 6,000\textendash 10,000 y, there are suggestions that grammatical structures might retain more signal over time than other subsystems, such as basic vocabulary. In this study, we use a Dirichlet process mixture model to infer the rates of change in lexical and grammatical data from 81 Austronesian languages. We show that, on average, most grammatical features actually change faster than items of basic vocabulary. The grammatical data show less schismogenesis, higher rates of homoplasy, and more bursts of contact-induced change than the basic vocabulary data. However, there is a core of grammatical and lexical features that are highly stable. These findings suggest that different subsystems of language have differing dynamics and that careful, nuanced models of language change will be needed to extract deeper signal from the noise of parallel evolution, areal readaptation, and contact.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces an extension of distinctive-collocate analysis that takes into account grammatical structure and is specifically geared to investigating pairs of semantically similar grammatical constructions and the lexemes that occur in them. The method, referred to as `distinctive-collexeme analysis', identifies lexemes that exhibit a strong preference for one member of the pair as opposed to the other, and thus makes it possible to identify subtle distributional differences between the members of such a pair. The method can be applied in the context of what is sometimes referred to as `grammatical alternation' (e.g. the dative alternation), but it can also be applied to other choices provided by the grammar (such as the two future tense constructions in English). The method has two main applications. First, it can reveal subtle differences between seemingly synonymous constructions, many of which are difficult to identify on the basis of more traditional approaches. Second, it can be used to investigate the very notion of `alternation'; we show that many alternations are much more restricted than has hitherto been assumed, and thus confirm the claims of recent, non-derivational views of grammar.},

Because language use varies across social contexts, and because social context must vary across independent experimental replications, linguists should not be surprised when experimental results fail to replicate at the expected rate. To address issues with replication failure in linguistics, and to increase methodological rigor in our field more generally, I argue that linguists must use experimental methods carefully, keeping in mind their inherent limitations, while acknowledging the scientific value of observational methods, which are often the only way to pursue basic questions in our field.},

It represents one of the most comprehensive descriptions of a northwestern Bantu language. The grammatical description, which is couched in a form-to-function approach, covers all levels of language, ranging from Gyeli phonology to its information structure and complex clauses. It draws on nineteen months of fieldwork carried out as part of the "Bagyeli/Bakola" DoBeS (Documentation of Endangered Languages) project between 2010 and 2014. The resulting multimodal corpus from that project, which includes texts of diverse genres such as traditional stories, narratives, multi-party conversations and dialogues, procedural texts, and songs, provides the empirical basis for the grammatical description. The documentary text collection, supplemented by data from elicitation work, questionnaires, and experiments, are accessible in the Bagyeli/Bakola collection of {$<$}em{$>$}The Language Archive{$<$}/em{$>$}. With additional ethnographic, sociolinguistic, diachronic, and comparative remarks, the grammar may appeal to a wider audience in general linguistics, typology, Bantu studies, and anthropology.

Here, we monitored continuous speech processing with magnetoencephalography (MEG) to unravel the principles of speech segmentation and coding. We demonstrate that speech entrains the phase of low-frequency (delta, theta) and the amplitude of highfrequency (gamma) oscillations in the auditory cortex. Phase entrainment is stronger in the right and amplitude entrainment is stronger in the left auditory cortex. Furthermore, edges in the speech envelope phase reset auditory cortex oscillations thereby enhancing their entrainment to speech. This mechanism adapts to the changing physical features of the speech envelope and enables efficient, stimulus-specific speech sampling. Finally, we show that within the auditory cortex, coupling between delta, theta, and gamma oscillations increases following speech edges. Importantly, all couplings (i.e., brain-speech and also within the cortex) attenuate for backward-presented speech, suggesting top-down control. We conclude that segmentation and coding of speech relies on a nested hierarchy of entrained cortical oscillations.},

  abstract = {Recent studies in several taxa have demonstrated that animal culture can evolve to become more efficient in various contexts ranging from tool use to route learning and migration. Under recent definitions, such increases in efficiency might satisfy the core criteria of cumulative cultural evolution (CCE). However, there is not yet a satisfying consensus on the precise definition of efficiency, CCE or the link between efficiency and more complex, extended forms of CCE considered uniquely human. To bring clarity to this wider discussion of CCE, we develop the concept of efficiency by (i) reviewing recent potential evidence for CCE in animals, and (ii) clarifying a useful definition of efficiency by synthesizing perspectives found within the literature, including animal studies and the wider iterated learning literature. Finally, (iii) we discuss what factors might impinge on the informational bottleneck of social transmission, and argue that this provides pressure for learnable behaviours across species. We conclude that framing CCE in terms of efficiency casts complexity in a new light, as learnable behaviours are a requirement for the evolution of complexity. Understanding how efficiency greases the ratchet of cumulative culture provides a better appreciation of how similar cultural evolution can be between taxonomically diverse species\textemdash a case for continuity across the animal kingdom.

In many languages, such terms comprise a dedicated category referred to as adjectives, however in some languages, for example Magar, words that describe property concepts are derived from other categories. In this paper, these derived terms are referred to as adjectivals. In Magar, all native terms describing property concepts are derived from verbs (i.e. nominalizations which function adnominally and as copular complements), or are verbs (in intransitive verb constructions). Underived `true' adjectives do exist in Magar, but these are entirely borrowings from the lingua franca, Nepali. The morphosyntactic behaviour of these two lexical classes, native adjectivals and borrowed adjectives, differs from each other and across the Magar dialects. The paper describes two dialects: Syangja and Tanahu. It is apparent that there is considerable and significant divergence with respect to the morphosyntax of both native adjectivals and borrowed adjectives. Moreover, data, especially from the more conservative dialect, Syangja, suggests that historically Magar may not have had an independent natural class of adjective. Rather property concepts were expressed by nouns or by verbs depending upon their time-stability \textendash{} more constant properties are expressed with nominal(ization)s and non timestable properties with verbs.},

It includes some well-established categories, such as evidentiality and epistemic modality (Boye, Kasper. 2012. Epistemic meaning: A crosslinguistic and functional-cognitive study. Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton), but also categories that have been less well described to-date. In this paper, I focus on one such category: the marking of epistemic authority, i.e. the encoding of ``the right to know or claim'' (Stivers, Tanya, Lorenza Mondada \& Jakob Steensig. 2011b. Knowledge, morality and affiliation in social interaction. In Stivers et al. 2011a). I explore how the marking of epistemic authority can be documented and analysed in the context of linguistic fieldwork. The discussion is based on a case study of Upper Napo Kichwa, a Quechuan language spoken in the Ecuadorian Amazon that exhibits a rich paradigm of epistemic discourse markers, encoding meanings related to epistemic authority and distribution of knowledge between discourse participants. I describe and appraise the methodology for epistemic fieldwork used in the Upper Napo Kichwa documentation and description project. I give a detailed account of the different tools and methods of data collection, showing their strengths and weaknesses. I also discuss the decisions made at the different stages of the project and their implications for data collection and analysis. In discussing these issues, I extrapolate from the case study, proposing practical solutions for fieldwork-based research on epistemic markers.},

In these contexts, speakers dynamically modify their communication across vocal (e.g., speaking rate) and gestural (e.g., co-speech gestures related in meaning to the content of speech) channels while speaking. What is the function of these adjustments? Here we test the hypothesis that speakers produced these multimodal adjustments to the service of communicative efficiency, to reduce cognitive effort and maximise likelihood of successful communication. While this hypothesis is not new, here we test whether it applies across vocal and gestural channels and across child and adult comprehenders. We assess whether speakers modulate word durations and produce gestures depending on the predictability (surprisal) of the words. Surprisal was computed from computational language models trained on corpora of Child-Directed, or Adult-Directed Language. We found that surprisal predicted speakers' multimodal adjustments in a new corpus of naturalistic interactions between adult-child (aged 3-4), and adult-adult. The effects were modulated by whether the comprehender was a child or an adult. Thus, communicative efficiency applies generally to multimodal language use not being limited to structural properties of language or vocal modality.},

These include concerns over their interpretability (how can numbers specifying abstract, latent dimensions represent meaning?) and their ability to capture variation in meaning (how can a single vector representation capture multiple different interpretations for the same expression?). Here, we demonstrate that semantic vectors can indeed rise up to these challenges, by training a mapping system (a simple linear regression) that predicts inter-individual variation in relational interpretations for compounds such as "wood brush" (for example "brush FOR wood", or "brush MADE OF wood") from (compositional) semantic vectors representing the meanings of these compounds. These predictions consistently beat different random baselines, both for familiar compounds ("moon light", Experiment 1) as well as novel compounds ("wood brush", Experiment 2), demonstrating that distributional semantic vectors encode variations in qualitative interpretations that can be decoded using techniques as simple as linear regression.},

  abstract = {Many descriptive grammars report the use of a linguistic pattern at the interface between discourse and syntax which is known generally as {$<$}em{$>$}tail-head linkage{$<$}/em{$>$}. This volume takes an unprecedented look at this type of linkage across languages and shows that there exist three distinct variants, all subsumed under the hypernym {$<$}em{$>$}bridging constructions{$<$}/em{$>$}. The chapters highlight the defining features of these constructions in the grammar and their functional properties in discourse. The volume reveals that: 	Bridging constructions consist of two clauses: a reference clause and a bridging clause. Across languages, bridging clauses can be subordinated clauses, reduced main clauses, or main clauses with continuation prosody. 	Bridging constructions have three variants: {$<$}em{$>$}recapitulative linkage{$<$}/em{$>$}, {$<$}em{$>$}summary linkage{$<$}/em{$>$} and {$<$}em{$>$}mixed linkage{$<$}/em{$>$}. They differ in the formal makeup of the bridging clause. 	In discourse, the functions that bridging constructions fulfil depend on the text genres in which they appear and their position in the text. 	If a language uses more than one type of bridging construction, then each type has a distinct discourse function. 	Bridging constructions can be optional and purely stylistic or mandatory and serve a grammatical purpose. 	Although the difference between bridging constructions and clause repetition can be subtle, they maintain their own distinctive characteristics.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Individuals vary widely in how they categorize novel and ambiguous phenomena. This individual variation has led influential theories in cognitive and social science to suggest that communication in large social groups introduces path dependence in category formation, which is expected to lead separate populations toward divergent cultural trajectories. Yet, anthropological data indicates that large, independent societies consistently arrive at highly similar category systems across a range of topics. How is it possible for diverse populations, consisting of individuals with significant variation in how they categorize the world, to independently construct similar category systems? Here, we investigate this puzzle experimentally by creating an online ``Grouping Game'' in which we observe how people in small and large populations collaboratively construct category systems for a continuum of ambiguous stimuli. We find that solitary individuals and small groups produce highly divergent category systems; however, across independent trials with unique participants, large populations consistently converge on highly similar category systems. A formal model of critical mass dynamics in social networks accurately predicts this process of scale-induced category convergence. Our findings show how large communication networks can filter lexical diversity among individuals to produce replicable society-level patterns, yielding unexpected implications for cultural evolution.},

He also showed how data could be "compressed" before transmission and how virtually error-free communication could be achieved. The concepts Shannon developed in his paper are at the heart of today's digital information technology. CDs, DVDs, cell phones, fax machines, modems, computer networks, hard drives, memory chips, encryption schemes, MP3 music, optical communication, high-definition television-all these things embody many of Shannon's ideas and others inspired by him.},

Although clicks have undergone subsequent developments in individual Nguni languages, no new click phonemes were acquired through language contact, showing that clicks were already present very early in the history of the Nguni languages. This relative chronology provides new insights into how the relations between Bantu- and Khoisan-speaking communities in southern Africa developed over time.},

Using original field data, I provide a grammatical sketch of Shetjhauba. First, the segmental phonology of Shetjhauba is described, providing an overview of its phonemic consonants and vowels, as well as a major morphophonological process that occurs in several morphological environments, referred to as ``strengthening''. A striking difference between the phonology of Shetjhauba and that of previously described Shekgalagadi varieties is its extensive use of click phonemes. Secondly, the nominal and verbal morphology of Shetjhauba are discussed, giving insights into noun classes, nominal derivation, and various pronouns and agreeing modifiers. Shetjhauba also has an extensive verbal morphology, with various verbal derivational suffixes, and inflectional affixes marking tense, aspect, mood, negation, as well as subject and object.},

  abstract = {The Ndebele language corpus described here is that compiled by the ALLEX Project (now ALRI) at the University of Zimbabwe. It is intended to reflect as much as possible the Ndebele language as spoken in Zimbabwe. The Ndebele language corpus was built in order to provide much-needed material for the study of the Ndebele language with a special focus on dictionarymaking and research. Like most corpora, the Ndebele language corpus may in future be used for other purposes not thought of at the time of its inception. It has been designed to meet generally acceptable standards so that it can be adaptable to various possible uses by various researchers. The article wants to outline the building process of the Ndebele language corpus with special emphasis on the challenges that faced compilers, and possible solutions. It is assumed that some of these challenges might not be peculiar to Ndebele alone but could also affect related African languages in a more or less similar situation. The main focus of the discussion will be the composition of the Ndebele language corpus, i.e. the type of texts that constitute the corpus. The corpus is composed of published texts, unpublished texts and oral material gathered from Ndebele-speaking districts of Zimbabwe. It will be argued that the use of the corpus and its reliability for research depends among other factors on its contents. It will also be shown that the contents of a corpus depend on a number of factors, some of which include sociolinguistic, political and economic considerations. These considerations have implications on both the content and quality of published and oral texts that constitute the Ndebele language corpus.},

Norming ratings from a subsequent experiment revealed that certain physical features (e.g., outstretched extremities) that correlate with Agent-hood could have contributed to rapid role recognition. In a final experiment, using identical twin actors, we then varied these features in two sets of stimuli, in which Patients had Agent-like features or not. Subjects recognized the roles of event participants less accurately when Patients possessed Agentlike features, with this difference being eliminated with two-second durations. Thus, given minimal visual input, typical Agent-like physical features are used in role recognition but, with sufficient input from multiple fixations, people categorically determine the relationship between event participants.},

This paper argues that the grammaticalization of object pronouns is fundamentally different to that of subject pronouns. More specifically, although object pronouns may be rapid early grammaticalizers, often losing prosodic independence and cliticizing to a verbal head, they do not advance further to reach the stage of obligatory agreement markers typical of subject agreement. Typically, object markers remain at the stage of Differential Object Indexing, where their realization is conditioned by a bundle of semantic and pragmatic factors exhibiting close parallels to those operative in Differential Object Marking. Evidence from language typology, and from the diachrony of person markers across two millennia of Iranian languages, is adduced to back up these claims. Thus the widely-assumed grammaticalization cline for the grammaticalization of agreement needs to be reconsidered; for object agreement, there is evidently an attractor state, that of Differential Object Indexing, beyond which object agreement seldom proceeds. Finally, explanations grounded in discourse data are proposed, which also account for why obligatory object agreement in the category of person is so rare, while gender and number agreement for objects is far less constrained.},

Sketchy reports of some kind of tonal contrast in this language surfaced in the 1960s and 1970s, only to disappear in later published references to the language. Our auditory and acoustic investigations confirm the existence of contrastive tone in Kara. Native speaker intuitions also support such a conclusion. At least two tonemes (high and low) are identified. A third tone level (mid) is also noted but appears to be a variant of the low toneme.},

This review article considers two such metrics, Surprisal and Entropy Reduction, which are respectively built upon the two most natural notions of `information value' for an observed event (Blachman 1968). This review sketches their conceptual background and touches on their relationship to other theories in cognitive science. It characterizes them as `lenses' through which theorists `see' the information-processing consequences of linguistic grammars. While these metrics are not themselves parsing algorithms, the review identifies candidate mechanisms that have been proposed for both of them.},

Phonology is frequently defined as the systematic organisation of the sounds of human language. For some, this includes aspects of both the surface phonetics together with systematic structural properties of the sound system; for others, phonology is seen as distinct from, and autonomous from, phonetics. The Routledge Handbook of Phonological Theory surveys the differing ways in which phonology is viewed, with a focus on current approaches to phonology. Divided into two parts, this handbook: Covers major conceptual frameworks within phonology including: Rule-based Phonology; Optimality Theory; Government phonology; Dependency phonology; and connectionist approaches to phonology; Foregrounds the central issue of the relationship between phonetics and phonology; Features 23 chapters written by leading academics from around the world. The Routledge Handbook of Phonological Theory is an authoritative and theory-neutral survey of this key field in linguistics, and is essential reading for students studying Phonology},

  abstract = {An unresolved issue in social perception concerns the effect of perceived ethnicity on speech processing. Bias-based accounts assume conscious misunderstanding of native speech in the case of a speaker classification as nonnative, resulting in negative ratings and poorer comprehension. In contrast, exemplar models of socially indexed speech perception suggest that such negative effects arise only when a contextual cue to the social identity is misleading, i.e. when ethnicity and speech clash with listeners' expectations. To address these accounts, and to assess ethnicity effects across different age groups, three non-university populations (N = 172) were primed with photographs of Asian and white European women and asked to repeat and rate utterances spoken in three accents (Korean-accented German, a regional German accent, standard German), all embedded in background noise. In line with exemplar models, repetition accuracy increased when the expected and perceived speech matched, but the effect was limited to the foreign accent, and\textemdash at the group level\textemdash to teens and older adults. In contrast, Asian speakers received the most negative accent ratings across all accents, consistent with a bias-based view, but group distinctions again came into play here, with the effect most pronounced in older adults, and limited to standard German for teens. Importantly, the effects varied across ages, with younger adults showing no effects of ethnicity in either task. The findings suggest that theoretical contradictions are a consequence of methodological choices, which reflect distinct aspects of social information processing.},

From this perspective, the meanings attached to linguistic expressions, in the form of conceptualisations, have various properties in common with visual forms of representation. This makes Cognitive Linguistics a potentially useful framework for identifying and analysing language-image relations in multimodal texts. In this paper, we investigate language-image relations with a specific focus on intersemiotic convergence. Analogous with research on gesture, we extend the notion of co-text images and argue that images and language usages which are proximal to one another in a multimodal text can be expected to exhibit the same or consistent construals of the target scene. We outline some of the dimensions of conceptualisation along which intersemiotic convergence may be enacted in texts, including event-structure, viewpoint, distribution of attention and metaphor. We take as illustrative data photographs and their captions in online news texts covering a range of topics including immigration, political protests, and inter-state conflict. Our analysis suggests the utility of Cognitive Linguistics in allowing new potential sites of intersemiotic convergence to be identified and in proffering an account of language-image relations that is based in language cognition.},

  abstract = {We discuss German examples where counterfactuals restricting an epistemic modal are embedded under glauben `believe'. Such sentences raise a puzzle for the analysis of counterfactuals, modals, and belief attributions within possible-worlds semantics. Their truth conditions suggest that the modal's domain is determined exclusively by the subject's belief state, but evaluating the counterfactual separately at each of the subject's doxastic alternatives does not yield the correct quantificational domain: the domain ends up being determined by the facts of each particular world, which include propositions the subject does not believe. We therefore revise the semantics of counterfactuals: counterfactuals still rely on an ordering among worlds that can be derived from a premise set (Kratzer, Angelika. 1978. Semantik der Rede: Kontexttheorie \textendash{} Modalw\"orter \textendash Konditionals\"atze (Monographien Linguistik und Kommunikationswissenschaft 38). K\"onigstein: Scriptor, 2012 [1981]a. The notional category of modality. In Modals and conditionals (Oxford studies in theoretical linguistics 36), 27\textendash 69. Oxford: Oxford University Press), but rather than uniquely characterizing a world, this premise set can be compatible with multiple worlds. In belief contexts, the attitude subject's belief state as a whole determines the relevant ordering. This, in turn, motivates a revision of the semantics of believe: following Yalcin's work on epistemic modals (Yalcin, Seth. 2007. Epistemic modals. Mind 116. 983\textendash 1026), we submit that evaluation indices are complex, consisting of a world and an ordering among worlds. Counterfactuals are sensitive to the ordering component of an index. Attitude verbs shift both components, relativizing the ordering to the attitude subject.},

The iconicity accounts of the relevant phenomena have been proposed by authorities like Jakobson, Haiman and Giv\'on, but I argue that these linguists did not sufficiently consider alternative usage-based explanations in terms of frequency of use. A closer look shows that the well-known Zipfian effects of frequency of use (leading to shortness and fusion) can be made responsible for all of the alleged iconicity effects, and initial corpus data for a range of phenomena confirm the correctness of the approach.},

I show that there are no good criteria for defining such a concept. I examine ten criteria in some detail (potential pauses, free occurrence, mobility, uninterruptibility, non-selectivity, non-coordinatability, anaphoric islandhood, nonextractability, morphophonological idiosyncrasies, and deviations from bi-uniqueness), and I show that none of them is necessary and sufficient on its own, and no combination of them gives a definition of `word' that accords with linguists' orthographic practice. `Word' can be defined as a language-specific concept, but this is not relevant to the general question pursued here. `Word' can be defined as a fuzzy concept, but this is theoretically meaningful only if the continuum between affixes and words, or words and phrases, shows some clustering, for which there is no systematic evidence at present. Thus, I conclude that we do not currently have a good basis for dividing the domain of morphosyntax into morphology and syntax, and that linguists should be very careful with general claims that make crucial reference to a cross-linguistic `word' notion.},

They are often taken for granted, but a closer examination of the literature reveals that they can have three rather different meanings: in the Dixonian approach, they are used as universal syntactic functions based on transitivity; in the Comrian approach, they are seen as comparative concepts for the two arguments of a typical action clause, and in the Bickelian approach, they are taken as generalized semantic roles (Dowtyan proto-roles). In this article, I explain the three approaches in some detail, and I argue that the Comrian approach is superior to the other two approaches. It is better than the Dixonian approach because it does not take an undefined transitivity notion for granted but defines transitivity in terms of A and P. It is also better than the Bickelian approach because the Dowtyan proto-roles were designed for the description of a particular class of English verbs; for crosslinguistic comparison, we need to limit ourselves to restricted (and semantically coherent) classes of verbs if we want to arrive at general statements.},

This article gives an overview of the most important generalizations about SVCs that have been proposed and that do seem to hold if a sufficiently restrictive definition of the concept is adopted. The main problem with the earlier comparative literature is that the notion of an SVC has not been delimited clearly, and/or has been formulated in much too wide terms. As a result, some linguists have despaired of finding a coherent cross-linguistic concept of SVC. For example, one scholar asked `Are there any universal defining properties of serial verb constructions? Probably not . . .'. These problems can be seen as a result of the confusion between comparative concepts and natural kinds: Serial verb constructions have (most often implicitly) been regarded as natural kinds (universal categories), so that phenomena in additional languages were regarded as SVCs even when they had somewhat different properties. This procedure inevitably leads to a fuzzy and very broad understanding of the concept, with a prototype (or `canonical') structure that does not allow falsifiable claims. Here I propose a narrow definition of SVC and formulate 10 universals that are apparently true of all serial verb constructions in this narrow sense. The claim that these are universally true of (narrowly defined) serial verb constructions is based on a thorough reading of the comparative and theoretical literature, not on a systematic sample of language\textemdash the latter would not have been practical, because SVCs are rarely described in sufficient detail in descriptive grammars.

  abstract = {Argument coding splits such as differential (= split) object marking and split ergative marking have long been known to be universal tendencies, but the generalizations have not been formulated in their full generality before. In particular, ditransitive constructions have rarely been taken into account, and scenario splits have often been treated separately. Here I argue that all these patterns can be understood in terms of the usual association of role rank (highly ranked A and R, low-ranked P and T) and referential prominence (locuphoric person, animacy, definiteness, etc.). At the most general level, the role-reference association universal says that deviations from usual associations of role rank and referential prominence tend to be coded by longer grammatical forms. In other words, A and R tend to be referentially prominent in language use, while P and T are less prominent, and when less usual associations need to be expressed, languages often require special coding by means of additional flags (casemarkers and adpositions) or additional verbal voice coding (e.g., inverse or passive markers). I argue that role-reference associations are an instance of the even more general pattern of form-frequency correspondences, and that the resulting coding asymmetries can all be explained by frequency-based predictability and coding efficiency.},

The term affix is sometimes thought to involve phonological ``fusion'' of some kind, but I propose that it is best defined as a bound non-root that cannot occur on roots of different classes. A bound form (or non-autono\- mous form) is generally defined as a form that does not occur on its own (thus, its definition makes no reference to phonology). As a term for a bound form that shows phonological interactions with its host, I propose the new term welded form. I discuss the ways in which these terms may (or may not) help us justify the syntax-morphology subdivision, and the ways in which these terms may perhaps be the basis for justifying speculative classifications such as the well-known isolating, agglutinative and flective types.},

  abstract = {This paper compares the concept pair indexing/flagging with the well-known concept pair head/dependent marking that is widely used in typology. It shows that a general concept of flagging (comprising case and adpositional marking) is needed, and it sketches the advantages of the indexing concept over the older idea of ``person agreement''. It then points out that the notions of head and dependent are hard to define (apart from the two basic domains of clauses and nominals), and that the head/dependent marking typology does not take the function of syntactic relation markers into account. On a functional view, both flags and indexes can be seen as roleidentifiers, as opposed to concordants (attributive agreement markers). After discussing three further issues with the head/dependent marking typology, involving construct markers, concordants, and cross-indexes, I conclude that the concept pair indexing/flagging is more suitable for typological purposes than head/dependent marking.},

  abstract = {Many researchers believe that pausing reflects planning, but if it does, what is the nature of that planning? This question tends to elicit two quite different answers, one based on the theoretical perspective of linguistics and the other on the assumptions of rhetoric. In this paper we examine two alternative hypotheses about the role of pauses in order to explore both planning itself and the theoretical paradigms which drive research on it. We focus on the most perplexing sub-set of these pauses - the long, "pregnant" pauses - and ask the question, "Why do writers pause?" In the first section we examine the evidence for both the linguistic and rhetorical hypotheses about planning. In the second section we present a new body of research on episodic patterns within the writing process itself. Since much of the significant pausing and planning one observes in writers appears to occur at the beginning of composing episodes, we use protocol analysis to look at the content and nature of these plans. We find that neither paragraph boundaries nor sentence-level shifts in idea development are good predictors of episode boundaries, but that goalrelated planning is. These results suggest some possible ways linguistic and rhetorical planning might interact.},

It arose due to the following combination: (a) rightheaded prosodic pattern in noun-modifier sequences; (b) loss of numeral classifiers which had previously protected nouns from the right-headed prosodic pattern when followed by numerals; and (c) transfer of tones from possessors to following possessums. Although none of these phenomena were semantically driven, the resulting configuration could only be reinterpreted by native speakers in semantic terms, creating a completely new system unique to Dogon. In spite of having arisen accidentally, this tonosyntactic system is quite stable. One of its benefits is the unusual solution it provided (at no extra charge) to a perennial problem in the design of relative constructions.},

Although interactive repair requires sophisticated cognitive abilities, it can be dissected into basic building blocks shared with nonhuman animal species. A review of the primate literature shows that interactionally contingent signal sequences are at least common among species of nonhuman great apes, suggesting a gradual evolution of repair. To pioneer a cross-species assessment of repair this paper aims at (i) identifying necessary precursors of human interactive repair; (ii) proposing a coding framework for its comparative study in humans and nonhuman species; and (iii) using this framework to analyse examples of interactions of humans (adults/children) and nonhuman great apes. We hope this paper will serve as a primer for cross-species comparisons on dealing with communicative breakdowns.},

Based on a review of these studies, which rest on a number of different methodological approaches and perspectives, the present paper argues that there is in fact converging evidence in support of the hypothesis that linguistic discourse has a dualistic structure. Central to this structure is a distinction between what tends to be referred to, respectively, as the microstructure and the macrostructure of discourse. Furthermore, it is argued that the distinction shows significant neurolinguistic correlations, and that these correlations concern the lateralization of the cerebral brain.},

What has been emerging as a new paradigm instead starts from the distribution of structures in the world, asking ``what's where why?'' I present here a concrete approach to this question, called `Distributional Typology'. The approach starts from causal theories on the forces that affect language change, from processing preferences to the historical contingencies of language contact. The predictions of these theories can then be tested against fine-grained matrices of cross-linguistic diversity, using statistical methods for estimating diachronic trends from synchronic distributions.},

Compounding is presumably the most common source of derivational categories and this applies in particular to modifying (endocentric) compounds, which are the main subject of this paper. By looking at three cases of grammatical change in English, German, and the West African language Ewe it is argued that the two frameworks differ in their goals and in their approaches. Both frameworks search for regularities in grammatical change, but whereas Construction Grammar has a focus on constructional change, that is, change in the development of constructions, the central question asked by students of grammaticalization is how and why, e.g., lexical categories give rise to grammatical (or functional) categories.},

Based on the framework of Discourse Grammar and building on Heine et al. (2021a, b), it is argued that their development involves a stage of cooptation, whereby a text piece is transferred from the sentence level to the metatextual level of discourse processing thus acquiring new grammatical properties, viz. independence from the host clause in terms of meaning, syntax and prosody, metatextual function, and positional freedom. All these changes are hard to reconcile with grammaticalization. At the same time, however, grammaticalization does play a role in the process once cooptation has taken place, affecting mainly the internal form of coopted expressions.},

Grammaticalization theory offers a tool for pushing linguistic reconstruction back to earlier phases of linguistic evolution, that is, to phases where human language or languages can be assumed to be different in structure from today's languages. Grammaticalization is defined as a process involving the development from lexical to grammatical forms, and from grammatical to even more grammatical forms and constructions. The assumptions and observations underlying the methodology of grammaticalization theory include development from early language to modern languages involved linguistic change, in which an important force driving linguistic change is creativity. Linguistic forms and structures have not necessarily been designed for the functions they currently serve. The grammaticalization of demonstratives shows that functional categories may change in such a way that they bear little resemblance to their original design. The first step in this process is from demonstrative to definite article and subsequently the element may develop further to be used for indefinite reference, and in a final stage the demonstrative may turn into a semantically largely empty marker of nominalization. Grammatical forms such as case, agreement, and voice markers are regarded as the result of gradual evolution, so that the earliest stage of human language that is reconstructable by the methodology of grammaticalization theory must have lacked grammatical categories such as case, agreement, and voice.},

  abstract = {Mixed-effects multilevel models are often used to investigate cross-level interactions, a specific type of context effect that may be understood as an upper-level variable moderating the association between a lower-level predictor and the outcome. We argue that multilevel models involving cross-level interactions should always include random slopes on the lower-level components of those interactions. Failure to do so will usually result in severely anti-conservative statistical inference. We illustrate the problem with extensive Monte Carlo simulations and examine its practical relevance by studying 30 prototypical cross-level interactions with European Social Survey data for 28 countries. In these empirical applications, introducing a random slope term reduces the absolute t-ratio of the cross-level interaction term by 31 per cent or more in three quarters of cases, with an average reduction of 42 per cent. Many practitioners seem to be unaware of these issues. Roughly half of the crosslevel interaction estimates published in the European Sociological Review between 2011 and 2016 are based on models that omit the crucial random slope term. Detailed analysis of the associated test statistics suggests that many of the estimates would not reach conventional thresholds for statistical significance in correctly specified models that include the random slope. This raises the question how much robust evidence of cross-level interactions sociology has actually produced over the past decades.},

This paper aims to provide the reader with tools to tease apart these three ways of conceptualising the variable of age. It reviews qualitative and quantitative methods from fields adjacent to LVC that will enable linguists of different theoretical interests to tap into biological and social aspects of ageing.

Distributions of pause, gap and overlap durations in conversations are presented, and methodological issues regarding the statistical treatment of such distributions are discussed. The results are related to published minimal response times for spoken utterances and thresholds for detection of acoustic silences in speech. It is shown that turn-taking is generally less precise than is often claimed by researchers in the field of conversation analysis or interactional linguistics. These results are discussed in the light of their implications for models of timing in turn-taking, and for interaction control models in speech technology. In particular, it is argued that the proportion of speaker changes that could potentially be triggered by information immediately preceding the speaker change is large enough for reactive interaction controls models to be viable in speech technology.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the question to what extent the parts-of-speech system of a language determines the morphosyntactic properties of that language. Taking the parts-of-speech hierarchy as originally proposed in Hengeveld (1992a, 1992b) and especially its distinction between flexible and rigid parts-of speech systems as its point of departure, the paper shows that languages with a high degree of lexical flexibility show a high degree of morphosyntactic rigidity, while languages with a high degree of lexical rigidity may or may not show a high degree of morphosyntactic flexibility. The paper furthermore shows that the flexibility and rigidity typical of parts-of-speech systems may extend to other areas of grammar, especially in the processes of lexical and syntactic derivation, and in the behaviour of classes of lexemes not covered by the parts-of-speech hierarchy.},

  abstract = {This paper argues that the word order possibilities of a language are partly determined by the parts-of-speech system of that language. In languages in which lexical items are specialized for certain functionally defined syntactic slots (e.g. the modifier slot within a noun phrase), the identifiability of these slots is ensured by the nature of the lexical items (e.g. adjectives) themselves. As a result, word order possibilities are relatively unrestricted in these languages. In languages in which lexical items are not specialized for certain syntactic slots, in that these items combine the functions of two or more of the traditional word classes, other strategies have to be invoked to enhance identifiability. In these languages word order constraints are used to make syntactic slots identifiable on the basis of their position within the clause or phrase. Hence the word order possibilities are rather restricted in these languages. Counterexamples to the latter claim all involve cases in which identifiability is ensured by morphological rather than syntactic means. This shows that there is a balanced trade-off between the syntactic, morphological, and lexical structure of a language.},

It is okay to want to change your own language use if it will make you feel better. But no one should make you feel bad about your language.

Researchers \textendash{} often implicitly \textendash{} assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these ``standard subjects'' are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species \textendash{} frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior \textendash{} hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.},

Three dimensions of lexical competence are proposed: (a) partial to precise knowledge, (b) depth of knowledge, and (c) receptive to productive use ability. The relationship between the two knowledge dimensions and the acquisition of word meaning is considered, with emphasis on the complexity of the semantization               1               process and on the need for redefining lexical development as both item-learning and system-changing. The adequacy of the three-dimensional description as a reflection of the process of vocabulary development is then discussed. Consideration of the nature of the developmental interrelationships among the dimensions raises two further questions: (a) Is depth of knowledge a prerequisite for developing precise comprehension? and (b) Are precise knowledge and depth of knowledge prerequisites for a word to become productive?},

  abstract = {This paper shows that patterns of application for several phonological processes and constraints in Limbu (Kiranti, Tibeto-Burman) reveals the relevance of hierarchical prosodic domains, including the syllable, foot, phonological word, and phonological phrase. In particular, an appeal to the phonological word uniformly accounts for the distribution of otherwise idiosyncratic alternations between the lateral approximant /l/ and the trill /r/. A prosodic domains account also reveals a mis-match between nominal compounds and verbal bipartite stems, with compounds consistently parsed as a single phonological word, and bipartite stems as hybrid in their prosodic organization. Limbu is of particular interest from a theoretical perspective, as the different morphological information referenced by the multiple phonological words in Limbu stands as a challenge to specific assumptions within the Prosodic Hierarchy Hypothesis (e.g. ``Clustering'' and ``Proper Bracketing'') . Typologically (within the Tibeto-Burman family), the prosodic alignments evidenced in Limbu are in some ways similar to those proposed for other related languages (e.g. the exclusion of prefixes from most prosodic domains), but also different in other ways (e.g. the organization of compounds).},

The core proposal here is that a distinction must be made between two basic types of syntactic constructions; namely, syntactic configurations for which prosodic phrasing is part of the definition of the construction, and phrase structure proper, which is independent of prosodic phrasing. This distinction implies a somewhat more complex view of the interface between syntax and prosody than is currently widely assumed. Rather than conceiving of prosodic phrases as derivative of syntactic phrases, prosodic phrasing and syntactic phrase structure are seen here as alternative ways of relating words to each other, forming larger units from smaller ones. Against this background, the emergence of phrase structure is conceived of as the emancipation of syntax from prosodic scaffolding.},

  pages = {192},
  abstract = {This paper analyzes three Falam Chin folktales for the purpose of identifying cohesive devices that create relations of meaning in texts. The investigation is based on a theoretical framework formulated out of three cohesion sources. The sources are Halliday and Hasan's Cohesion of English, Dooley and Levinsohn's Analyzing Discourse (2001), and Halliday and Matthiessen's An Introduction to Functional Grammar (2004). The integrated framework covers four major categories of cohesive devices, such as (i) identity, (ii) conjunction, (iii) inflectional pattern, and (iv) lexical relation. The first category, identity, is divided into four subclasses: reference, other pro-forms, substitution, and ellipsis. The second category, conjunction, is divided into eight subclasses: apposition, clarification, addition, variation, spatio-temporal, manner, causal-conditional, and matter. The third category, inflection pattern, deals with devices that mark identity or consistency in a sequence of clauses and sentences. The final category, lexical relation, contain five subsets: repetition, synonymy, hyponymy, meronymy, and collocation. The theoretical framework is applied to the analysis of the three folktales, and the findings showed that three of the four major categories of cohesion were found in all the stories. These categories are identity, conjunction, and lexical relation. Of these three categories, lexical relation indicates the highest frequency of occurrence at 63\%, and the category with the lowest frequency points to conjunction at 6\%. The third major type of cohesion, inflectional pattern, was not found in any of the stories.},

This paper explores students' understandings, approaches and experiences of independent learning and how they may become more effective independent learners. This large scale qualitative study, funded by the HEA, included students-asresearchers, independent learning diaries, and student-led interviews. Findings suggest that students initially use low level reinforcing and organising skills and in later stages of their courses develop higher level extending and applying skills. Clearer guidance, clearer tasks and in-course support are amongst the students' recommendations for enhancing independent learning. However the most powerful influence on their independent learning was the support, collaboration and advice of other (more experienced) students in non-assessed scenarios. These findings have implications for staff involved in induction, student support, curriculum design and for staff and officers in Students' Unions.},

  abstract = {Investigations of iconicity in language, whereby interactants coordinate meaningful bodily actions to create resemblances, are prevalent across the human communication sciences. However, when it comes to analysing and comparing iconicity across different interactions (e.g., deaf, deafblind, hearing) and modes of communication (e.g., manual signs, speech, writing), it is not always clear we are looking at the same thing. For example, tokens of spoken ideophones and manual depicting actions may both be analysed as iconic forms. Yet spoken ideophones may signal depictive and descriptive qualities via speech, while manual actions may signal depictive, descriptive, and indexical qualities via the shape, movement, and placement of the hands in space. Furthermore, each may co-occur with other semiotics articulated with the face, hands, and body within composite utterances. The paradigm of iconicity as a single property is too broad and coarse for comparative semiotics, as important details necessary for understanding the range of human communicative potentialities may be masked. Here, we draw on semiotic approaches to language and communication, including the model of language as signalled via describing, indicating and/or depicting and the notion of non-referential indexicality, to illustrate the multidimensionality of iconicity in co-present interactions. This builds on our earlier proposal for analysing how different methods of semiotic signalling are combined in multimodal language use. We discuss some implications for the language and communication sciences and explain how this approach may inform a theory of biosemiotics.},

This article outlines a corpus-driven approach to identifying clause-like units in a native signed language and investigates the use of pointing signs, depicting signs, gestures and enactments to express core elements of possible clause-like units in Auslan narratives. We explore the frequency and distribution of the core argument and predicate elements of single clause-like units that were identified in elicited retellings of an Aesop's fable which have been archived in the Auslan Corpus. Core elements of these units are described according to sign type, the order in which they appear, and handedness (articulation with the strong or weak hand). We find that one third of core elements of the single clause-like units in these Auslan narratives are expressed via pointing signs, depicting signs, gestures and enactments, in various orders. This study uses empirical corpus-based data to contribute insights into the use of composite utterances in a signed language and therefore on the way meaning is negotiated between interactants.},

In this paper, I will discuss the status of multimodal usage-events (multimodal constructs) for the potential entrenchment of multimodal constructions and their implications for human cognition in general. As I will argue, constructionist approaches need to pay more attention to the role of the working memory in assembling and interpreting constructions. Drawing on verbal as well as gesture constructions, I will show that it is essential to distinguish entrenched constructions that are stored in the long-term memory from form-meaning pairings that are assembled in the working memory (online constructions). Once this distinction is made, the precise role of multimodal constructs and the nature of multimodal constructions can finally be disentangled.},

The second analysis was a quantile regression using ASL assessments to predict English print abilities. Different ASL skills were important for English reading comprehension (SAT-RC) versus understanding English syntax (RITLS); the relationship between ASL skills and English print performance also varied for students at different English print ability levels. Strikingly, knowledge of ASL syntax was robustly correlated with knowledge of English syntax at all ability levels.

Psycholinguistic research, by contrast, has shown that phonological properties also play a role (Kelly 1992, Monaghan               et al.               2005). This study reports on a production experiment involving English nonce nouns and verbs. The data confirm the importance of phonology, whilst also suggesting that distributional facts are involved in lexical categorisation. Together with the existing psycholinguistic evidence, the results show that both the generative and cognitive models of word classes are too restricted. However, the usage-based model can accommodate the facts straightforwardly. This was already anticipated by Taylor (2002) but is worked out in more detail here by elaborating on his notion of phonological ``sub-schemas'' and by bringing together insights from Croft (1991, 2001) related to discourse propositional act constructions and recent suggestions by Langacker (2008b) concerning ``summary scanning'' and ``sequential scanning''.},

The paper offers a typological description of negation within the whole language family from an onomasiological perspective. But some remarks on the etymology of certain negators are made as well. There are three main patterns of ``standard negation''. The historically oldest type (A) employs a negative verb similar to the Uralic languages, the second pattern (B) is a grammaticalized version of the first (possibly influenced by Nivkh) and the third type (C) is an innovation influenced by Mongolian, in which the negative existential replaced the negative verb. Some preliminary proposals are made for the development of a ``conceptual space'', which also includes non-standard negation such as negative copulas, negative existentials, and prohibitives. The discussion contains examples from more than 35 languages.},

I argue two things: (i) language-specific phonotactic constraints on phonological forms can inhibit otherwise regular innovations, and (ii) the fact that such phonotactically-motivated process inhibition occurs in historical phonology is itself evidence for the reality of phonotactic constraints. I assume that there is a difference between those gaps in a language's lexicon which are due to chance (`A-gaps') and those which are ruled out by the grammar (`S-gaps') and I consider some evidence in favour of this view. I consider two case studies where an understanding of phonotactics is necessary to analyse the patterning of change: Mid-Scots \texttheta -debuccalisation and a late Middle English syncope. I ground the discussion in arguments about what phonotactic constraints are, and how they can be involved in diachrony. This involves a consideration of a number of examples from English, including onsetOCP-related constraints, the OCP (sibilance) constraint, and the constraint which imposes the defective distribution of [h].},

This observation contrasts with non-serializing languages, such as English, in which only one of the two meaning components is expressed by the main verb. By examining the morphosyntactic and semantic properties of two types of resultative constructions, namely resultative secondary predication and means constructions, I develop a novel configurational analysis within the generative framework of Distributed Morphology that models cross-linguistic variation in terms of the morphosyntactic size and the semantic composition of the respective meaning components and their interaction with idiosyncratic requirements on roots and argument structure. Based on original fieldwork, I demonstrate that despite the superficial differences in categorial status, Oceanic RSVCs are an instance of the means construction, in which the manner verb directly adjoins to a causative verb modifying the underspecified causing event entailed in the event structure of the causative predicate. Consequently, serializing and nonserializing languages do not vary significantly in their morphosyntactic and semantic composition with further implications for the typology of resultatives in the world's languages.},

However, this typology has been based primarily on non-serializing languages such as English and certain Romance varieties, in which the secondary manner or result predicate is necessarily non-verbal. This contrasts with resultatives in serializing languages, in which both the manner and result component are realized by verbal predicates, making it difficult to determine the underlying syntactic status of the respective predicates. By investigating the morphosyntactic and semantic properties of resultative serial verb constructions (RSVCs) in two serializing languages, Mandarin and Samoan, I argue that RSVCs are neither a uniform nor special phenomenon (contra Larson 1991; Slobin 2004), but show the same split observed in non-serializing languages. This observation has further implications on a unified configurational analysis of manner and result meaning within a syntactic account of event and argument structure building.},

  abstract = {This study provides the first systematic, international, large-scale evidence on the extent and nature of multiple institutional affiliations on journal publications. Studying more than 15 million authors and 22 million articles from 40 countries we document that: In 2019, almost one in three articles was (co-)authored by authors with multiple affiliations and the share of authors with multiple affiliations increased from around 10\% to 16\% since 1996. The growth of multiple affiliations is prevalent in all fields and it is stronger in high impact journals. About 60\% of multiple affiliations are between institutions from within the academic sector. International co-affiliations, which account for about a quarter of multiple affiliations, most often involve institutions from the United States, China, Germany and the United Kingdom, suggesting a core-periphery network.

We discuss potential causes and show that the timing of the rise in multiple affiliations can be linked to the introduction of more competitive funding structures such as ``excellence initiatives'' in a number of countries.

  abstract = {RIT Research Corporation Rochester, NY Glottal stops that occur invowel-consonant-vowel context are often not realized as stops at all, but rather show voicing that is continuous throughout the glottal constriction gesture. Glottal articulations that are realized in this way are apparently marked by reductions in amplitude and fundamental frequency. In the present study measurements from naturally produced utterances containing the sequence /olo/ (i.e., a glottal stop separating two identical vowels) were used to create a set of synthetic stimuli that varied in their Fo and amplitude contours. The utterances were resynthesized in six ways: (a)original pitch/original amplitude, (b)original pitch/flat amplitude, (c)flat pitch/original amplitude, (d) flat pitch/flat amplitude, (e) flat pitch/inverted amplitude, and (f)inverted pitch/flat amplitude. Results indicated that: (a)a dip inthe pitch contour is nearly always sufficient to cue the presence of a glottal stop in the absence of any drop in amplitude, (b)a dip inthe amplitude contour is usually sufficient to cue the presence of a glottal stop, and (c)signals with inverted contours were not heard as glottal stops, indicating that it is not merely an abrupt change that is needed to signal a glottal stop.},

Much of the recent work has focused on describing bias and providing an overview of bias in a larger context. Here, we provide a simple, actionable summary of this recent work. We outline five sources where bias can occur in NLP systems: (1) the data, (2) the annotation process, (3) the input representations, (4) the models, and finally (5) the research design (or how we conceptualize our research). We explore each of the bias sources in detail in this article, including examples and links to related work, as well as potential counter-measures.},

The proposed analysis implies that although Isbukun contains prevocalic consonant-glide sequences and postvocalic glide-consonant strings, complex syllable margins are in fact not tolerated in the language.},

The results indicated that these learners consulted a dictionary most often to find out the pronunciation of a new word and least often to learn the frequency of use and appropriate usage of an unknown word. Participants most often based their guesses of a word's meaning from the paragraph's main ideas and background information. Using the meaning of individual parts of an unfamiliar compound word (such as note-book) and the part of speech of a new word were the least-used guessing strategies.},

Those final words were also embedded in non-MWE contexts which did not provide the high contextual predictability as the MWEs for comparison. According to the eye movement data we collected, both English L1 and L2 readers were sensitive to co-occurrences between words in the MWEs; both our L1 and L2 subjects showed significantly lower fixation probability and shorter fixation duration for the final words in the MWEs. Next, we conducted an input training task, which targeted seven MWEs for which one subgroup of the L2 subjects did not show the transitional probability sensitivity. In the training task we compared two types of input treatments: frequent input (providing multiple instances of exposure to the MWEs) and textually enhanced input (using textual enhancement to highlight the MWEs).

This framework combines cognitive linguistics with dependency grammar, so it assumes that the full power of domain-general cognition is available for syntax, and that syntactic structure can be conceived as a network of relations between individual words. In this network, words are related by at least two kinds of link: dependencies and `landmark' links that determine word order. To handle the special characteristics of pied-piping, the analysis also includes a single special relation, `pipee', which links the `piper' (the               wh               -type word) to the word which replaces it in the landmark structure. The analysis is applied in detail to English, and then compared with previous analyses and extended to accommodate both the pied-piping with inversion found in Meso-American languages, and the boundary markers found in other languages.},

  abstract = {Semantic variation in the cutting and breaking domain has been shown to be constrained across languages in a previous typological study, but it was unclear whether Japanese was an outlier in this domain. Here we revisit cutting and breaking in the Japonic language area by collecting new naming data for 40 videoclips depicting cutting and breaking events in Standard Japanese, the highly divergent Tohoku dialects, as well as four related Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Okinawa, Miyako and Yaeyama). We find that the Japonic languages recapitulate the same semantic dimensions attested in the previous typological study, confirming that semantic variation in the domain of cutting and breaking is indeed cross-linguistically constrained. We then compare our new Japonic data to previously collected Germanic data and find that, in general, related languages resemble each other more than unrelated languages, and that the Japonic languages resemble each other more than the Germanic languages do. Nevertheless, English resembles all of the Japonic languages more than it resembles Swedish. Together, these findings show that the rate and extent of semantic change can differ between language families, indicating the existence of lineage-specific developments on top of universal cross-linguistic constraints.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have detailed a remarkable degree of genetic and linguistic diversity in Northern Island Melanesia. Here we utilize that diversity to examine two models of genetic and linguistic coevolution. The first model predicts that genetic and linguistic correspondences formed following population splits and isolation at the time of early range expansions into the region. The second is analogous to the genetic model of isolation by distance, and it predicts that genetic and linguistic correspondences formed through continuing genetic and linguistic exchange between neighboring populations. We tested the predictions of the two models by comparing observed and simulated patterns of genetic variation, genetic and linguistic trees, and matrices of genetic, linguistic, and geographic distances. The data consist of 751 autosomal microsatellites and 108 structural linguistic features collected from 33 Northern Island Melanesian populations. The results of the tests indicate that linguistic and genetic exchange have erased any evidence of a splitting and isolation process that might have occurred early in the settlement history of the region. The correlation patterns are also inconsistent with the predictions of the isolation by distance coevolutionary process in the larger Northern Island Melanesian region, but there is strong evidence for the process in the rugged interior of the largest island in the region (New Britain). There we found some of the strongest recorded correlations between genetic, linguistic, and geographic distances. We also found that, throughout the region, linguistic features have generally been less likely to diffuse across population boundaries than genes. The results from our study, based on exceptionally fine-grained data, show that local genetic and linguistic exchange are likely to obscure evidence of the early history of a region, and that language barriers do not particularly hinder genetic exchange. In contrast, global patterns may emphasize more ancient demographic events, including population splits associated with the early colonization of major world regions.},

The acoustic and articulatory correlates of rhotic vowels, and their development and geographical distribution in Kalasha and other Indo-Iranian languages are still poorly understood. The current study brings together typological data on retroflex approximants and flaps in 192 Indo-Iranian language varieties, and phonetic data on rhotic vowels and retroflex approximants in endangered Dardic (Kalasha and Dameli) and Nuristani (Kamviri and Eastern Kataviri) languages. The phylogeography of retroflex approximants and flaps indicates that rhotic vowels are prevalent in those areas of South Asia where retroflex approximants are in abundance. Specifically, the development of rhotic vowels in Kalasha may have been amplified by the presence of retroflex approximants in neighboring Nuristani languages. We show that phonetically the rhotic sounds in the two Dardic languages are produced with a bunched tongue shape, whereas the retroflex approximants in Nuristani languages are produced with the raising of the tongue tip.},

  abstract = {In this paper I argue for a property-driven approach to phonological typology. Rather than seeking to classify or label languages, the central goal of phonological typology is to determine how different languages systematize the phonetic substance available to all languages. The paper focuses on a very murky area in phonological typology, word-prosodic systems. While there is agreement that certain properties converge to characterize two prosodic prototypes, tone and stress, the term ``pitch-accent'' is frequently adopted to refer to a defective tone system whose tone is obligatory, culminative, privative, metrical, and/or restricted in distribution. Drawing from a database of ca. 600 tone systems, I show that none of these properties is found in all systems claimed to be accentual and that all five are amply attested in canonical tone systems. Since all one can say is that alleged pitch-accent systems exhibit significant constraints on the distribution of their tonal contrasts, they do not constitute a coherent prosodic ``type''. Rather, alleged ``pitch-accent'' systems freely pick-and-choose properties from the tone and stress prototypes, producing mixed, ambiguous, and sometimes analytically indeterminate systems which appear to be ``intermediate''. There thus is no pitch-accent prototype, nor can prosodic systems be treated as a continuum placed along a single linear dimension. The paper concludes that the goal of prosodic typology should not be to classify languages, but rather the properties of their subsystems.},

  abstract = {For languages to survive as complex cultural systems, they need to be learnable. According to traditional approaches, learning is made possible by constraining the degrees of freedom in advance of experience and by the construction of complex structure during development. This article explores a third contributor to complexity: namely, the extent to which syntactic structure can be an emergent property of how simpler entities \textendash{} words \textendash{} interact with one another. The authors found that when naturalistic child directed speech was instantiated in a dynamic network, communities formed around words that were more densely connected with other words than they were with the rest of the network. This process is designed to mirror what we know about distributional patterns in natural language: namely, the network communities represented the syntactic hubs of semi-formulaic slot-and-frame patterns, characteristic of early speech. The network itself was blind to grammatical information and its organization reflected (a) the frequency of using a word and (b) the probabilities of transitioning from one word to another. The authors show that grammatical patterns in the input disassociate by community structure in the emergent network. These communities provide coherent hubs which could be a reliable source of syntactic information for the learner. These initial findings are presented here as proof-of-concept in the hope that other researchers will explore the possibilities and limitations of this approach on a larger scale and with more languages. The implications of a dynamic network approach are discussed for the learnability burden and the development of an adult-like grammar.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Studies of speech processing investigate the relationship between temporal structure in speech stimuli and neural activity. Despite clear evidence that the brain tracks speech at low frequencies (\textasciitilde\,1~Hz), it is not well understood what linguistic information gives rise to this rhythm. In this study, we harness linguistic theory to draw attention to Intonation Units (IUs), a fundamental prosodic unit of human language, and characterize their temporal structure as captured in the speech envelope, an acoustic representation relevant to the neural processing of speech. IUs are defined by a specific pattern of syllable delivery, together with resets in pitch and articulatory force. Linguistic studies of spontaneous speech indicate that this prosodic segmentation paces new information in language use across diverse languages. Therefore, IUs provide a universal structural cue for the cognitive dynamics of speech production and comprehension. We study the relation between IUs and periodicities in the speech envelope, applying methods from investigations of neural synchronization. Our sample includes recordings from every-day speech contexts of over 100 speakers and six languages. We find that sequences of IUs form a consistent low-frequency rhythm and constitute a significant periodic cue within the speech envelope. Our findings allow to predict that IUs are utilized by the neural system when tracking speech. The methods we introduce here facilitate testing this prediction in the future (i.e., with physiological data).},

SVC is a common phenomenon in isolating languages which lack morphological markers for syntactic processes.

This research attempts to analyse the typological characteristics of Sikkanese SVCs which cover: prosodic/phonological, morpho-syntactic, and semantic features of SVCs in Sikkanese. The theory adopted in this research is typological theory which is applied by Van Stedent and Ger Reesink (2008) in analysing SVCs in East-Nusantara languages. The prosodic characteristic shows that Sikkanese SVCs fell under one intonation contour, similar to the intonation of a single clause and without being separated by a pause; morphosyntactically SVCs in Sikkanese could be categorised into independent and some belong to co-dependent type without any morphological markers; and symantically they could be analysed ~into: (1) motion; (2) direction, (3) manner; (4) instrument; (5) purpose; (6) progressive; (7) ~modality.},

Yet it is still a poorly understood construct. After briefly reviewing several investigations of this construct in cognitive science, I propose a unified account that considers cognitive flexibility a property of the cognitive system, rather than a cognitive skill. The emergence of cognitive flexibility is dependent on two kinds of interactions: the interaction of several cognitive mechanisms, and the interaction of sensorimotor mechanisms, cognition, and context in developmental time. The quest for a comprehensive and unified account of cognitive flexibility is highly justified given its potential usefulness in fostering efficient problem solving and creativity.},

The scope of the corpus is endless in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Parallel corpus is a very useful resource for most of the applications of NLP, especially for Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). The SMT is the most popular approach of Machine Translation (MT) nowadays and it can produce high quality translation result based on huge amount of aligned parallel text corpora in both the source and target languages. Although Bodo is a recognized natural language of India and co-official languages of Assam, still the machine readable information of Bodo language is very low. Therefore, to expand the computerized information of the language, English to Bodo SMT system has been developed. But this paper mainly focuses on building English-Bodo parallel text corpora to implement the English to Bodo SMT system using Phrase-Based SMT approach. We have designed an E-BPTC (English-Bodo Parallel Text Corpus) creator tool and have been constructed General and Newspaper domains English-Bodo parallel text corpora. Finally, the quality of the constructed parallel text corpora has been tested using two evaluation techniques in the SMT system.},

While morphological categories such as roots or stems are sometimes subject to templatic requirements involving an obligatory final consonant, independent evidence for a requirement of this kind on genuine prosodic constituents, such as surface prosodic words, is sparse. This paper shows that, while McCarthy's treatment remains, in its essentials, a model of optimality-theoretic analysis, it is unnecessary to take recourse to FINAL-C once the onset requirements for different levels of the prosodic hierarchy, together with their associated faithfulness properties, are better understood.},

Apart from expressing plurality, intensity, distributivity, and other well-known iconic meanings, reduplication often derives forms that do not have quantitative differences from the original words. I propose that the relation between the original and reduplicated forms can be described not only through the notion of doubling, but also through inexact similarity. I further introduce a list of meanings that are based on the idea of similarity and are found in reduplicated forms in many languages. In particular, it concerns such functions of reduplication as a change of lexical class, expressing similarity and pejorativity. Attenuative and emphatic meanings of reduplication, as well as marking some oppositions in verbal systems, can be explained through the combination of the similarity and quantitative meanings. The main conclusion of the study is that the correlation between the form and the meaning of reduplicated forms is much stronger than is usually considered, and the notion of iconicity relating to reduplication should be significantly extended.},

I argue that such theories are crucial in any mental domain, not just for their own sake, but to guide experimental inquiry, as well as to integrate the domain into the mind as a whole. To illustrate the criteria of adequacy for theories of mental representation, I compare two theoretical approaches to language: classical generative grammar (Chomsky, 1965, 1981, 1995) and the parallel architecture (Jackendoff, 1997, 2002). The grounds for comparison include (a) the internal coherence of the theory across phonology, syntax, and semantics; (b) the relation of language to other mental faculties; (c) the relationship between grammar and lexicon; (d) relevance to theories of language processing; and (e) the possibility of languages with little or no syntax.},

We sought to narrow down what kind of facilitation leads to repetition reduction. Repetition could, in principle, facilitate production on a conceptual, lexical, phonological, articulatory, or acoustic level (Kahn \& Arnold, 2015). We compared the durations of the second utterance of a target word when the initial production was aloud or silent. The silent presentation either involved unmouthed or mouthed inner speech. Overt production, unmouthed and mouthed inner speech all led to reduction in target word onsets, but target word durations were only shortened when a word was initially said aloud. In an additional experiment, we found that prior naming of a homophone of the target word also led to duration reduction. The results suggest that repetition reduction occurs when there is a recently experienced auditory memory of the item. We propose that duration may be controlled in part by auditory feedback during production, the use of which can be primed by recent auditory experience.},

This prediction is tested against data from syntactic reduction. A single multilevel logit model analysis of naturally distributed data from a corpus of spontaneous speech is used to assess the effect of information density on complementizer that-mentioning, while simultaneously evaluating the predictions of several influential alternative accounts: availability, ambiguity avoidance, and dependency processing accounts. Information density emerges as an important predictor of speakers' preferences during production. As information is defined in terms of probabilities, it follows that production is probability-sensitive, in that speakers' preferences are affected by the contextual probability of syntactic structures. The merits of a corpus-based approach to the study of language production are discussed as well.},

Our approach involves three steps: First, distributions of phylogenies are inferred from lexical data. Second, these phylogenies are used as part of a statistical model to estimate transition rates between parameter states. Finally, the long-term equilibrium of the resulting Markov process is computed. As a case study, we investigate a series of potential word-order correlations across the languages of the world.},

In the first part, four lines of research on the encoding effect are summarized: 1) manipulation of the lecture material, 2) manipulation of the method of note-taking, 3) the importance of individual differences, and 4) the testing procedure used in the empirical studies. This review highlights the fragmented nature of the current literature. In the second part of this review five forms of cognitive load that are induced by note-taking are distinguished. Cognitive load theory is used to integrate the divergent results in the literature. Based on the review, it is concluded that cognitive load theory provides a useful framework for future theory development and experimental work.},

Secondly, the paper investigates the nonmanual prosody of coordination: nonmanual activity is shown both to mark the juncture of the coordinand clauses and to draw their contours. Finally, the paper addresses certain forms of clausal coordination in FinSL that are sign language-specific. It is suggested that the sign languagespecific properties of coordination are caused both by the fact that signers can use two manual articulators in the production of sentences and by the pervasive iconicity of sign language structure.},

Bridging constructions occur in all the texts examined for the study, with frequency and type of construction varying according to narrator and text type. Recapitulative linkage is far more common than either summary linkage, which is limited to first-person narratives and reported speech, or mixed linkage, which serves to summarize direct quotations in oral and written texts with a more literary character. In terms of function, the analysis shows that bridging constructions in White Hmong narrative texts work cohesively, linking one unit in the event line of the narrative to the next and thus serving to progress the main sequence of events. The event described by the bridging construction is constructed as a salient point in the event line, and becomes the base from which the next unit in the event line of the narrative proceeds.},

The rise of multimodal studies in linguistics allows incorporating yet another semiotic layer into the description. In this context, we present a cross-linguistic study of multimodal event construals in Czech and English spontaneous conversations, based on multimodal corpora. We follow Croft's (2012) cognitive model of aspectual types, in order to take into account multiple parameters (out of which the features of (un)boundedness and directedness are the most prominent) determining a particular aspectual contour of a verb in a given context. We investigate which feature combinations are associated with (un)boundedness of corresponding co-speech gestures. The multivariate analysis revealed that in English, gesture boundedness is predicted by the predicate's general aspectual type, whereas in Czech, the more fine-grained features of directedness and incrementality are stronger predictors.},

What sets the Iatmul case apart from similar constructions in other languages is the possibility to resubordinate the predicate. This constitutes an alternative way to complete the path from bi- to monoclausal status. Rather than continuing the `de-marking' of the originally subordinate verb in the direction of main clause functions, the available marking is exploited so that the previously desubordinated verb can be used in a crosslinguistically unusual type of focus relative clause. There, focus marking is lost on the obligatorily overt subject when the latter is a lexical noun, but is maintained on pronouns. In this case, both nominal and verbal morphology are formally those of a cleft construction, but syntactically the structure is monoclausal.},

A survey of previous descriptions reveals a lack of consensus in the analysis of these converbs. Too often they have been pressed into a Eurocentric dichotomy of subordination versus coordination, leading to confusion about their typological status. Trying to correct this approach by describing the language on its own terms is therefore the main objective of our paper. We compare the morphosyntactic behavior of four selected suffixes with respect to some relevant criteria for subordination versus coordination, such as the scope of illocutionary operators, shared TAM, subject coreference, constituent order, and the development of dependent verb forms into complex predicates or adpositions. This empirical research feeds back into the theoretical discussion, as it will be shown that the Korean converbs can indeed be described using conventional typological concepts if construed appropriately. Our second objective is therefore to review the criteria involved in describing clause-linkage and to see how relevant terminology can be used more consistently. The conclusion is that the four converb types turn out to be located on a continuum between coordination and subordination, thus constituting an instantiation of syntaxsemantics isomorphism.},

Current theories of sentence processing furthermore make competing predictions on whether longer expressions are preferentially placed as early or as late as possible. Here we test these predictions using hierarchical distributional regression models that allow estimates of word order and word order variation at the level of individual dependencies in corpora from 71 languages, while controlling for confounding effects from the type of dependency (e.g., subject vs. object), and the type of clause (main vs. subordinate) involved as well as from trends that are characteristic of individual languages, language families, and language contact areas. Our results show the expected correlations of length with position and variation only for two out of six dependency types (obliques and nominal modifiers) and no difference between clause types. These findings challenge received theories of across-the-board effects of complexity on word order and word order variation and call for theoretical models that relativize effects to specific kinds of syntactic structures and dependencies.},

Linguistic theories of event encoding draw a distinction between bounded events that include an inherent endpoint (``eat a pretzel'') and unbounded events that lack such an endpoint (``eat cheerios''). Even though the literature on event cognition has not focused on such abstract aspects of event structure, we hypothesize that sensitivity to boundedness could shape the way events are processed. In the present study, we show that viewers are sensitive to event boundedness in a category identification task and distinguish it from event completion; furthermore, viewers identify bounded events more easily than unbounded events. Sensitivity to boundedness emerges even when viewers are prevented from encoding the events linguistically and thus does not depend on the online use of linguistic distinctions. We conclude that event cognition relies on highly abstract properties of events and their boundaries, and sketch implications of these findings for the way events are described, processed, and used to interact with the world.},

In a phrasal-decision study, we compared reaction times for triads of three-word sequences, corresponding to idiomatic expressions, compositional phrases, and phrasal fragments, while controlling for phrase and substring frequencies. Chunk meaningfulness, as assessed by a separate subjective rating study, was found to speed up decision times for all three types of strings: The more meaningful a multiword sequence was judged to be, the faster it was processed, independently of whether it was idiomatic, compositional in nature, or a phrasal fragment. These results highlight the importance of taking meaning into account when considering the processing of multiword chunks, consistent with predictions of construction-based approaches to language.},

However, computational models of semantic memory have seen a surge progress in the last two decades, advancing our knowledge of how meaning is constructed from experience, how knowledge is represented and used, and what processes are likely to be culprit in disorders characterized by semantic impairment. This chapter provides an overview of several recent clusters of models and trends in the literature, including modern connectionist and distributional models of semantic memory, and contemporary advances in grounding semantic models with perceptual information and models of compositional semantics. Several common lessons have emerged from both the connectionist and distributional literatures, and we attempt to synthesize these themes to better focus future developments in semantic modeling.},

  abstract = {While the prevailing theoretical orthodoxy of North American archaeology overwhelmingly discourages consideration of transoceanic cultural diffusion, linguistic and archaeological evidence appear to indicate at least one instance of direct cultural contact between Polynesia and southern California during the prehistoric era. Three words used to refer to boats - including the distinctive sewn-plank canoe used by Chumashan and Gabrielino speakers of the southern California coast - are odd by the phonotactic and morphological standards of their languages and appear to correlate with Proto-Central Eastern Polynesian terms associated with woodworking and canoe construction. Chumashan and Gabrielino speakers seem to have borrowed this complex of words along with the sewn-plank construction technique itself sometime between ca. A.D. 400 and 800, at which time there is also evidence for punctuated adaptive change (e.g., increased exploitation of pelagic fish) and appearance of a Polynesian style two-piece bone fishhook in the Santa Barbara Channel. These developments were coeval with a period of major exploratory seafaring by the Polynesians that resulted in the discovery and settlement of Hawaii - the nearest Polynesian outpost to southern California. Archaeological and ethnographic information from the Pacific indicates that the Polynesians had the capabilities of navigation, boat construction, and sailing, as well as the cultural incentives to complete a one-way passage from Hawaii to the mainland of southern California. These findings suggest that diffusion and other forms of historical contingency still need to be considered in constructions of North American prehistory.           ,              R\'esum\'e             Itural transoce\'anica, la evidencia ling\"u\'istica y arqueol\'ogica parece indicar por lo menos un caso del contacto cultural directo entre Polinesia y California meridional durante la era prehist\'orica. Tres palabras utilizaron para referirse a barcos - inclusive la canoa distintivo de tabl\'on-cosido utilizada por hablantes de Chumashan y Gabrielino de la costa meridional de California - son raros para los est\'andares fonot\'acticos y morfol\'ogicos de sus idiomas, y parecen tener correlaci\'on con los t\'erminos polinesios Orientales y Proto-Centrales, asociados con el trabajo de madera y la construcci\'on de la canoa. Hablantes de Chumashan y Gabrielino parecen haber tornado prestado este complejo de palabras junto con la t\'ecnica de la construcci\'on de tabl\'on cosido, alguna vez entre 400 y 800 A.D. hay tambi\'en evidencia del cambio puntual de adaptaci\'on (por ejemplo, la explotaci\'on aumentada del pez pel\'agico) y la apariencia de un anzuelo polinesio estilizado de hueso de dos-pedazo en el Canal de Santa Barbara. Estos desarrollos eran contempor\'aneos con unper\'iodo de exploraci\'on mar\'itima mayor por los polinesios, que tuvieron como resultado el descubrimiento de Hawaii, el puesto polinesio m\`as cercano a California meridional. La arqueolog\'ia y la informaci\'on etnogr\'afica del Pac\'ifico indica que los polinesios tuvieron capacidades para la navegaci\'on y la construcci\'on de barcos, as\'i como los est\'imulos culturales para completar el viaje en una Jornada de Hawaii a la tierra continental de California meridional. Estos hallazgos sugieren que la difusi\'on y otras formas de contingencia hist\'orica todav\'ia necesitan ser consideradas en la construcci\'on de la prehistoria norteamericana.},

The studies investigating fluency, however, have been difficult to compare because the measures of fluency that were used differed widely. One of the differences between studies concerns the lower cut-off point for silent pauses, which has been set anywhere between 100 ms and 1000 ms. The goal of this paper is to find an optimal cut-off point. We calculate acoustic measures of fluency using different pause thresholds and then relate these measures to a measure of L2 proficiency and to ratings on fluency.},

To explain this variation, it has been suggested that changes in eye physiology, due to UV-light incidence, can lead to abnormalities in blue-green color perception which causes the color lexicon to adapt. Here, we apply advanced statistics on a set of 142 populations to model how different factors shape the presence of a specific term for blue. In addition, we examined if the ontogenetic effect of UV-light on color perception generates a negative selection pressure against inherited abnormal red-green perception. We found the presence of a specific term for blue was influenced by UV incidence as well as several additional factors, including cultural complexity. Moreover, there was evidence that UV incidence was negatively related to abnormal red-green color perception. These results demonstrate that variation in languages can only be understood in the context of their cultural, biological, and physical environments.},

  abstract = {Speech-accompanying gestures constitute one information channel during communication. Some have argued that processing gestures engages the brain regions that support language comprehension. However, studies that have been used as evidence for shared mechanisms suffer from one or more of the following limitations: they (a) have not directly compared activations for gesture and language processing in the same study and relied on the fallacious reverse inference (Poldrack, 2006) for interpretation, (b) relied on traditional group analyses, which are bound to overestimate overlap (e.g., Nieto-Casta\~non and Fedorenko, 2012), (c) failed to directly compare the magnitudes of response (e.g., Chen et al., 2017), and (d) focused on gestures that may have activated the corresponding linguistic representations (e.g., ``emblems''). To circumvent these limitations, we used fMRI to examine responses to gesture processing in language regions defined functionally in individual participants (e.g., Fedorenko et al., 2010), including directly comparing effect sizes, and covering a broad range of spontaneously generated co-speech gestures. Whenever speech was present, language regions responded robustly (and to a similar degree regardless of whether the video contained gestures or grooming movements). In contrast, and critically, responses in the language regions were low \textendash{} at or slightly above the fixation baseline \textendash{} when silent videos were processed (again, regardless of whether they contained gestures or grooming movements). Brain regions outside of the language network, including some in close proximity to its regions, differentiated between gestures and grooming movements, ruling out the possibility that the gesture/grooming manipulation was too subtle. Behavioral studies on the critical video materials further showed robust differentiation between the gesture and grooming conditions. In summary, contra prior claims, language-processing regions do not respond to co-speech gestures in the absence of speech, suggesting that these regions are selectively driven by linguistic input (e.g., Fedorenko et al., 2011). Although co-speech gestures are uncontroversially important in communication, they appear to be processed in brain regions distinct from those that support language comprehension, similar to other extra-linguistic communicative signals, like facial expressions and prosody.},

It is argued that in these constructions, the main verbs as well as the auxiliaries are marked for tense. It is also claimed that every clause contains two temporal heads: a higher T(Past) and a lower T(Future). The biclausality of periphrastic tenses is then a consequence of the way in which tense is represented in syntax: with only two temporal heads per clause, many complex tenses have to be formed by means of embedding. The analysis thus involves a revision of the tense systems set up by Reichenbach (1947) and Vikner (1985), and also of the proposal concerning the universal inventory of temporal heads put forth by Cinque (1999).},

Turkish postpositional phrases provide chunks comprised of a frequently co-occurring case suffix on the complement followed by a postposition. According to the Linear Fusion Hypothesis (Bybee 2002), such chunks provide ideal conditions for phonological fusion. In contrast to this view, this paper shows that there is no fusion between the frequently co-occurring case suffixes and postpositions. Instead, postpositions following an uninflected form of complement have a greater chance of turning into case suffixes or clitics than those following a case-inflected form. Case suffixes serve as constant indicators of a word boundary before postpositions, thereby blocking the bonding between the postposition and the complement. Simple frequency and linearity, therefore, cannot be the sole conditions in the morphologization of postpositions.},

  abstract = {On-line comprehension studies of flexible word-order languages find that noncanonical (`scrambled') structures induce more difficulty than canonical structures [e.g., Hyo\textasciidieresis na\textasciidieresis{} \& Hujanen, Q. J. Exp. Psychol. 50A (1997) 841\textendash{} 858], with this difference being attributed to the structural complexity/infrequency of these forms. However, by presenting sentences in isolation, most existing studies have not examined the extent to which processing patterns can be explained by discourse factors. In Finnish, an articleless flexible word-order language with canonical SVO order, word order can be used to encode the given/new distinctions: OVS marks the object as given and the subject as new; SVO is more flexible, being used in multiple contexts. Thus, the observed dispreference for noncanonical orders in previous work may arise from additional presuppositions needed to understand them out of context [cf. Crain \& Steedman, Natural Language Parsing, (1985), 320\textendash{} 358]. Two experiments were conducted to examine these issues in Finnish. Experiment 1 used a self-paced reading task to show that the usual difficulty associated with noncanonical constructions is partially alleviated in the presence of appropriate discourse contexts. In Experiment 2, the eye gaze of listeners was tracked as they heard spoken descriptions of scenes, so as to test whether specific on-line referential processes are involved in SVO/OVS comprehension: Upon hearing an OV\ldots{} sequence, Finnish listeners should expect the upcoming noun to be discourse-new, whereas an SV\ldots{} sequence makes no such prediction. The results confirmed these predictions. As compared to SVO, OVS sentences showed anticipatory eye movements to a discourse-new referent at the second noun onset, even before participants had enough acoustic information to recognize this word. Our findings illustrate that in a flexible word-order language, a noncanonical order can result in anticipatory processes regarding the discourse status of a yet-to-be-heard constituent.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            This paper reports an automatic data-driven analysis for describing prototypical intonation patterns, particularly suitable for initial stages of prosodic research and language description. The approach has several advantages over traditional ways to investigate intonation, such as the applicability to spontaneous speech, language- and domain-independency, and the potential of revealing meaningful functions of intonation. These features make the approach particularly useful for language documentation, where the description of prosody is often lacking. The core of this approach is a cluster analysis on a time-series of f0 measurements and consists of two scripts (Praat and R, available from               https://constantijnkaland.github.io/contourclustering/               ). Graphical user interfaces can be used to perform the analyses on collected data ranging from spontaneous to highly controlled speech. There is limited need for manual annotation prior to analysis and speaker variability can be accounted for. After cluster analysis, Praat textgrids can be generated with the cluster number annotated for each individual contour. Although further confirmatory analysis is still required, the outcomes provide useful and unbiased directions for any investigation of prototypical f0 contours based on their acoustic form.},

Minimal existing work provides impressionistic descriptions of the tone system and leads to diverging claims. Apart from lexical contrasts, tones are reported to be affected by sociolinguistic variables such as clan and gender, as well as by elicitation setting. The present study explores these factors using f0 contours found in monosyllabic words that were produced by speakers that differed in gender, clanlectal background and in different elicitation contexts. Cluster analyses were used to explore the f0 variation. Preliminary results suggest interactions between speaker and elicitation context and shed a new light on the realisation of tones in Kera'a.},

Through hierarchical inference, a language learner can distribute credit for a pronunciation between the intended phone and the larger units in which it is embedded, such as triphones, morphemes, words and larger syntactic constructions and collocations. In this way, hierarchical inference resolves the longstanding debate about the unit of sound change: it is not necessary for change to affect only sounds, or only words. Instead, both can be assigned their proper amount of credit for a particular pronunciation of a phone. Hierarchical inference is shown to generate novel predictions for the emergence of stable variation. Under standard assumptions about linguistic generalization, it also generates a counterintuitive prediction of a U-shaped frequency effect in an advanced articulatorilymotivated sound change. Once the change has progressed far enough for the phone to become associated with the reduced pronunciation, novel words will be more reduced than existing words that, for any reason, have become associated with the unreduced variant. Avoiding this prediction requires learners to not consider novel words to be representative of the experienced lexicon. Instead, learners should generalize to novel words from other words that are likely to exhibit similar behavior: rare words, and the words that occur in similar contexts. Directions for future work are outlined.},

  abstract = {Imaginative pretend play is often thought of as the domain of young children, yet adults regularly engage in elaborated, fantastical, social-mediated pretend play. We describe imaginative play in adults via the term ``pretensive shared reality;'' Shared Pretensive Reality describes the ability of a group of individuals to employ a range of higherorder cognitive functions to explicitly and implicitly share representations of a bounded fictional reality in predictable and coherent ways, such that this constructed reality may be explored and invented/embellished with shared intentionality in an ad hoc manner. Pretensive Shared Reality facilitates multiple individual and social outcomes, including generating personal and group-level enjoyment or mirth, the creation or maintenance of social groups, or the safe exploration of individual self-concepts (such as alternative expression of a players sexual or gender identity). Importantly, Pretensive Shared Reality (both within the specific context of table-top role-playing games, and other instances) are primarily co-operative and co-creative. We draw on multiple examples, and focus on Table-Top Role Playing games (TTRPG) \textendash{} and specifically, the most popular and enduring table-top role-playing games, Dungeons \& Dragons (D\&D) \textendash{} as a primary example of such play. Our conception of ``pretensive shared reality'' links the widespread existence and forms of adult imaginative play to childhood pretense, places it within a developmental and evolutionary context, and argues that pretensive shared realities \textendash which underpin many forms of imaginative culture \textendash{} are an important topic of study unto themselves, and may be utilized to provide methodological insight into a variety of psychological domains.},

Cross-linguistic lexification patterns have been shown to be largely predictable, as similar concepts are often colexified. We test a recent claim that, beyond this general tendency, communicative needs play an important role in shaping colexification patterns. We approach this question by means of a series of human experiments, using an artificial language communication game paradigm. Our results across four experiments match the previous cross-linguistic findings: all other things being equal, speakers do prefer to colexify similar concepts. However, we also find evidence supporting the communicative need hypothesis: when faced with a frequent need to distinguish similar pairs of meanings, speakadjust their colexification preferences to maintain communicative efficiency and avoid colexifying those similar meanings which need to be distinguished in communication. This research provides further evidence to support the argument that languages are shaped by the needs and preferences of their speakers.},

His investigations of over forty years, from 1892 to 1933, particularly in the Andean area including Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, northwest Argentina and central-south Chile, were dedicated to linguistics and ethnography, archeology and the historical processes of the pre-Hispanic peoples. This article provides an overall view of Uhle\textasciiacute s work, and links these works with the Germanic tradition he belongs to, calls attention on his interdisciplinary proposal and highlights the political intentionality he ascribed to pre-Hispanic historical investigations in South America.},

This chapter provides a brief survey into some of the respects in which this is the case at the discourse and lexical levels. The data argue for a rich notion of event structure that makes crucial reference to different types of association, and illustrate how the importance of event structure in linguistic theory goes beyond merely accounting for the representation of events and the semantics of the words used to express them.},

Specifically, we show that voicing, aspiration and glottalisation occur at most once per onset, nucleus or coda in a given language, and that the order in which they are produced within onset, nucleus and coda is never contrastive. To account for these restrictions, we propose that laryngeal features are properties not of segments, but of the onsets, nuclei and codas that dominate them.},

Focusing on the Nepal Himalayas, which has high language diversity that extends beyond areal, genetic, and historical categorization, the paper examines similarities across grammars and the influences motivating these. It reports on the construction and use of a database comprising materials from 18 descriptive grammars of Tibeto-Burman languages of Nepal written over a 30-year period. This includes a small sub-database of metadata noting grammarian linguistic training, career affiliations, and dissertation supervisors and a larger sub-database of fully tagged tables of contents for each of the grammars. The overarching relational database links sections containing similar content, enabling search functions to explore the locations of similar information and feature labels across grammars in the database. While some grammar-features in the corpus reflect broader structural properties across grammars, findings indicate strong local influences. We find evidence of three foundational linguistic ``schools'' connecting the structural organization of the grammars across multiple generations of linguists, correspondences across chapter titles, sections, as well as school-influenced organization of verbal paradigms, treatment of marginal topics, and terminological choices.},

The grammatical structure of G\=an'g\=ou has been shown to exhibit an Altaic-type orientation (verb-final syntax, case system etcetera), while the phonology of G\=an'g\=ou, which has only recently been examined, is of a Sinitic type. The questions asked are, how has the phonology of G\=an'g\=ou changed as compared to its ancestor Old Mandarin on the one hand and Mandarin languages outside the Amdo Sprachbund on the other? How is it similar to other Northwest Mandarin varieties and where does it possibly differ? It has been found that G\=an'g\=ou shows significant phonological similarities with the other members of the Northwest Mandarin branch. Also, many of the phonological innovations in G\=an'g\=ou seem to be typical of the languages of the Amdo Sprachbund as a whole, further establishing the position of G\=an'g\=ou as a member of the Sprachbund. Eight innovations are discussed, seven related to retentions or losses in the medial or coda part of the syllable, one related to tone reduction. After an overview of the syllable structure and phonemic inventory of G\=an'g\=ou, these innovations are presented in turn.},

To correct this survivorship bias, we applied unseen species models from ecology to gauge the loss of narratives from medieval Europe, such as the romances about King Arthur. The estimates obtained are compatible with the scant historic evidence. In addition to events such as library fires, we identified the original evenness of cultural populations as an overlooked factor in these assemblages' stability in the face of immaterial loss. We link the elevated evenness in island literatures to analogous accounts of ecological and cultural diversity in insular communities. These analyses call for a wider application of these methods across the heritage sciences.           ,              Ecological methods for cultural history                            Much of the narrative literature from the European Middle Ages has been lost over the ages because of manuscript physical degradation and destruction, including library fires. Kestemont               et al               . show that established methods from ecology for estimating the numbers of unseen species can be applied to abundance data representing cultural artifacts to estimate the losses that ancient cultural domains have sustained over the centuries.

For example, insular literatures, such as those from Iceland and Ireland, combine a surprisingly strong cultural persistence with an elevated distributional evenness. \textemdash AMS                        ,              Quantitative ecological methods can be used to estimate the extent of losses of medieval narrative literature.},

While these claims have not explicitly been extended to intonation in previous work, researchers such as F\'ery (2010) have suggested that multiple South Asian languages (SALs) from different families can be covered with the same intonational description, and that prominence and weight play no role in its implementation. The current study examines what is arguably the most characteristic unit of SAL prosody, the repeated rising contour (RRC), produced in recordings of The North Wind and the Sun in six SALs to confirm the existence of some crosslinguistic similarities while also identifying areas of substantial variation. I highlight the roles played by lexical accent, vowel peripherality, and vowel length in the alignment of tones, and describe variation within and across languages. I also suggest directions in which research must be carried out to expand our typological understanding of the region and propose a model flexible enough to cover its diverse languages.},

Bilinguals outperformed their monolingual counterparts on divergent thinking trait of cognitive flexibility, and bilinguals' performance on this trait could be explained by their TLP effect.

  abstract = {A comprehensive theory of child language acquisition requires an evidential base that is representative of the typological diversity present in the world's 7,000 or so languages. However, languages are dying at an alarming rate, and the next 50 years represents the last chance we have to document acquisition in approximately half of them. In the current paper we take stock of the last 45 years of research published in the four main child language acquisition journals: Journal of Child Language, First Language, Language Acquisition, and Language Learning and Development. We coded each article for the following variables: (i) language(s), (ii) topic(s), and (iii) country of author affiliation, from each journal's inception until the end of 2020. We found that we have at least one article published on around 103 languages, representing only around 1.5\% of the world's languages. The distribution of articles was highly skewed towards English and other well-studied Indo-European languages, with the majority published on non-Indo-European languages having just one paper. There was a more even distribution of topics across language categories, but a vast majority of the research was produced in the Global North. The number of articles published on non-IndoEuropean languages from countries outside of North America and Europe is increasing; however, this increase is driven by research conducted in relatively wealthy countries. We conclude that, despite a proud history of crosslinguistic research, the goals of the discipline need to be recalibrated before we can lay claim to truly a representative account of child language acquisition.},

  abstract = {This book is a comprehensive description of the grammar of Rapa Nui, the Polynesian language spoken on Easter Island. After an introductory chapter, the grammar deals with phonology, word classes, the noun phrase, possession, the verb phrase, verbal and nonverbal clauses, mood and negation, and clause combinations. The phonology of Rapa Nui reveals certain issues of typological interest, such as the existence of strict conditions on the phonological shape of words, word-final devoicing, and reduplication patterns motivated by metrical constraints. For Polynesian languages, the distinction between nouns and verbs in the lexicon has often been denied; in this grammar it is argued that this distinction is needed for Rapa Nui. Rapa Nui has sometimes been characterised as an ergative language; this grammar shows that it is unambiguously accusative. Subject and object marking depend on an interplay of syntactic, semantic and pragmatic factors. Other distinctive features of the language include the existence of a `neutral' aspect marker, a serial verb construction, the emergence of copula verbs, a possessive-relative construction, and a tendency to maximise the use of the nominal domain. Rapa Nui's relationship to the other Polynesian languages is a recurring theme in this grammar; the relationship to Tahitian (which has profoundly influenced Rapa Nui) especially deserves attention. The grammar is supplemented with a number of interlinear texts, two maps and a subject index.},

  abstract = {Devoicing of high vowels (HVD) in Tokyo Japanese applies in two environments\textemdash between voiceless consonants, and between a voiceless consonant and a ``pause''\textemdash and applies variably as a function of a number of factors. The role and definition of ``pause'' in this process, in terms of a physical pause or prosodic position (word or phrase boundary), remains unclear, as does what is expected when these environments overlap, and why HVD appears to be categorical in some environments and variable in others. This paper addresses three outstanding issues about HVD\textemdash the role of ``boundary phenomena'' (prosodic position and physical pauses), the relationship between the two environments, and the sources of variability in HVD\textemdash by examining vowel devoicing in a large corpus of spontaneous Japanese. We use mixed-effects logistic regression to model how boundary phenomena affect the likelihood of devoicing and modulate the effects of other variables, controlling for other major factors, including a measure of gestural overlap. The results suggest that all boundary phenomena jointly affect devoicing rate, and that prosodic phrase boundaries play a key role: variability in HVD looks qualitatively different for phrase-internal and phrase-final vowels, which are affected differently by word frequency, speech rate, and pause duration. We argue the results support an account of HVD as the result of two overlapping vowel devoicing processes, each widelyattested cross-linguistically: devoicing between voiceless consonants, and devoicing before prosodic phrase boundaries. Variability in the application of these two processes can then be partially explained in terms of aspects of phonetic implementation and processing: gestural overlap (Beckman 1996), which often plays a role in reduction processes, and the locality of production planning (Wagner 2012), a recent explanation for variability in the application of external sandhi processes.},

The morphosyntax of predicative demonstratives is first briefly examined, followed by a typological characterization based primarily on semantic and morphosyntactic grounds. Predicative demonstratives focus on the immediately surrounding spatial, temporal, or textual environment of the speech act, showing restrictions on occurring in negated clauses or questions. In terms of lexical categorization, predicative demonstratives most commonly find themselves in a small closed word class of non-verbal predicators. Four types of predicative demonstratives are proposed here: Presentatives, identifiers, localizers, and the rare copular demonstratives.},

In (Denmark-)Norway there was also a strong purist movement, which campaigned against the use of Latinate syntax, including present participle clauses. There was no similar campaign in England. The diverging development of present participle converbs in the two languages can - at least partly - be explained as a result of these two facts.},

  abstract = {This study investigates how Korean stem-final consonant clusters /ps/, /ks/, /lp/, /lk/, /ls/, and /lm/ exhibit variation, when a vowel-initial inflectional suffix is attached to noun stems. It is well-established that the Korean stem-final consonant clusters are either fully faithfully preserved (i.e. conservative), or simplified by deleting one of the two consonantal elements C1 and C2 (i.e. innovative). However, there has been no study about dominant patterns across clusters: which consonant cluster is more prone to preservation or simplification when inflected. When it comes to simplification, it has also been unclear which of C1 or C2 undergoes deletion, and why. Results of a production experiment show that there is a stark dichotomy between the clusters that share the same [{$\pm$}sonorant] feature (/ps/, /ks/, /lm/) and those that do not (/lp/, /lk/, /ls/): the former preferred conservative forms, whereas the latter favored innovative forms. Innovative forms in particular are accounted for in relation to consonant cluster simplification in isolation forms of nouns, following Kenstowicz's (1996) Base-Identity effect. While the nature of the consonant cluster turned out to be a significant factor for variation in inflected forms, other factors (inflectional suffixes, speakers' regional dialects, and gender) did not. This study is significant, in that it sheds light on a blind spot in the discussions of variation in stem-final consonant clusters in Korean and provides a comprehensive analysis that connects consonant cluster simplification in isolation forms with conservative/innovative forms in inflected forms.\&nbsp;},

The analysis is based on data elicited using a list of 80 verbal meanings from the Valency Classes in World's Languages project (Hartmann, Haspelmath \&amp; Taylor 2013) and on data collected from the corpus of RSL (Burkova 2015). The study shows that RSL has lexical verbs with different sets of arguments (from zero up to three arguments), and a number of argument structure alternations, such as causative-inchoative, impersonal, reflexive, and reciprocal. It is found that argument structure of lexical verbs and argument structure alternations that apply to them in RSL are typologically common. This implies that the semantic basis of argument structure is independent of modality. In addition, RSL uses classifier predicates whose argument structure is determined by the type of the classifier and by the context. Although such predicates in other sign languages have been used to argue for a syntactic approach to argument structure, RSL classifier predicates do not provide a strong support for this approach.},

  abstract = {Language is the primary repository and mediator of human collective knowledge. A central question for evolutionary linguistics is the origin of the combinatorial structure of language (sometimes referred to as duality of patterning), one of language's basic design features. Emerging sign languages provide a promising arena to study the emergence of language properties. Many, but not all such sign languages exhibit combinatoriality, which generates testable hypotheses about its source. We hypothesize that combinatoriality is the inevitable result of learning biases in cultural transmission, and that population structure explains differences across languages. We construct an agent-based model with population turnover. Bayesian learning agents with a prior preference for compressible languages (modelling a pressure for language learnability) communicate in pairs under pressure to reduce ambiguity. We include two transmission conditions: agents learn the language either from the oldest agent or from an agent in the middle of their lifespan. Results suggest that (1) combinatoriality emerges during iterated cultural transmission under concurrent pressures for simplicity and expressivity and (2) population dynamics affect the rate of evolution, which is faster when agents learn from other learners than when they learn from old individuals. This may explain its absence in some emerging sign languages. We discuss the consequences of this finding for cultural evolution, highlighting the interplay of population-level, functional and cognitive factors.

They have been used to enhance automatic segmentation of speech, classification of patients with communication disorders, the design of psycholinguistic models of speaking, and the analysis of psychological disorders. However, although pause data is easy to collect under natural conditions, it has had little impact on recent research in cognitive psychology, involving learning, memory and individual differences for example. This alleged omission probably reflects a general preference for de-contextualised paradigms in that area, the cost in time of speech segmentation, and the number and variety of variables that influence pause duration. But the most challenging issues concern the basic characteristics of pauses. What are they, and how many different types of pauses merit consideration? In this paper we introduce an analytic approach that addresses and answers fundamental questions about pauses. The critical steps were as follows: (a) recognition that pause and speech segment duration distributions are skewed and reflect several component processes, (b) adoption of the assumption that the distributions reflect log-normal variability, and independent confirmation of the discovery that pause distributions include two component processes (Campione and Veronis, 2002), and (c) use of signal detection theory to estimate individual as distinct from universal thresholds to distinguish those contributions.},

Instead, I assume that the same syntactic and semantic constraints interact to determine the grammaticality of both extraposed and non-extraposed relative clauses. Syntactically, the proposed constraints lead to the configurational superiority of the relative clause. This superiority has its origin in the semantics of the relative clause: the relative pronoun is referentially defective and remedies this deficiency by selecting an appropriate antecedent.

  abstract = {Gestures that spontaneously accompany speech convey information coordinated with the concurrent speech. There has been considerable theoretical disagreement about the process by which this informational coordination is achieved. Some theories predict that the information encoded in gesture is not influenced by how information is verbally expressed. However, others predict that gestures encode only what is encoded in speech. This paper investigates this issue by comparing informational coordination between speech and gesture across different languages. Narratives in Turkish, Japanese, and English were elicited using an animated cartoon as the stimulus. It was found that gestures used to express the same motion events were influenced simultaneously by (1) how features of motion events were expressed in each language, and (2) spatial information in the stimulus that was never verbalized. From this, it is concluded that gestures are generated from spatio-motoric processes that interact on-line with the speech production process. Through the interaction, spatio-motoric information to be expressed is packaged into chunks that are verbalizable within a processing unit for speech formulation. In addition, we propose a model of speech and gesture production as one of a class of frameworks that are compatible with the data.},

These are labeled as object-, animacy- and role-based strategies. In the first case, the mere objecthood (i.e. the contrast to the Agent) determines the marking of objects. In the animacy-based strategy, animate Themes and Recipients are encoded in the same way as animate Patients, while the marking of inanimate Themes corresponds to inanimate Patients. In the rolebased strategy, Theme and Recipient are marked on the basis of the semantic roles they bear. All the types are examined in light of cross-linguistic data, in addition to which the rationale behind the types is also discussed. It is shown that the three strategies suffice to explain object marking in ditransitives and that the strategies can all be explained on the basis of the nature of three-participant events and the principles of economy and distinctiveness.},

These studies have shown that despite the significant differences in the number of formally distinct evidentiality categories, languages tend to have grammaticalized markers for certain information sources, but not for others; different kinds of sensory perception, inference, assumption and hearsay evidence are among those information sources that receive explicit coding. In this paper, another evidence type, namely general knowledge, will be examined. It will be shown that general knowledge differs from other information sources in its nature, but it also has features in common with them. In addition, a formal-functional typology of general knowledge coding will be proposed based on the nature of the element used for this purpose. Finally, the rationale behind the discussed types and the central theoretical implications of the paper will be discussed. The attested types either stress the peculiar nature of general knowledge providing evidence for its independent information source status, or they emphasize the common features shared by general knowledge and other information sources, most notably reliability of information.},

We present a novel method for characterizing the information structure of sentences across a diverse set of languages. While the structure of English is broadly consistent with the shape predicted by optimal coding, many languages are not consistent with this prediction. We proceed to show that the characteristic information curves of languages are partly related to a variety of typological features from phonology to word order. These results present an important step in the direction of exploring upper bounds for the extent to which linguistic codes can be optimal for communication.},

  abstract = {Successful speech perception requires that listeners map the acoustic signal to linguistic categories. These mappings are not only probabilistic, but change depending on the situation. For example, one talker's /p/ might be physically indistinguishable from another talker's /b/ (cf. lack of invariance). We characterize the computational problem posed by such a subjectively nonstationary world and propose that the speech perception system overcomes this challenge by (1) recognizing previously encountered situations, (2) generalizing to other situations based on previous similar experience, and (3) adapting to novel situations. We formalize this proposal in the ideal adapter framework: (1) to (3) can be understood as inference under uncertainty about the appropriate generative model for the current talker, thereby facilitating robust speech perception despite the lack of invariance. We focus on two critical aspects of the ideal adapter. First, in situations that clearly deviate from previous experience, listeners need to adapt. We develop a distributional (belief-updating) learning model of incremental adaptation. The model provides a good fit against known and novel phonetic adaptation data, including perceptual recalibration and selective adaptation. Second, robust speech recognition requires listeners learn to represent the structured component of cross-situation variability in the speech signal. We discuss how these two aspects of the ideal adapter provide a unifying explanation for adaptation, talker-specificity, and generalization across talkers and groups of talkers (e.g., accents and dialects). The ideal adapter provides a guiding framework for future investigations into speech perception and adaptation, and more broadly language comprehension.},

We investigate whether the decline in global atmospheric CO2 concentration by 7e10 ppm in the late 1500s and early 1600s which globally lowered surface air temperatures by 0.15+C, were generated by natural forcing or were a result of the large-scale depopulation of the Americas after European arrival, subsequent land use change and secondary succession. We quantitatively review the evidence for (i) the pre-Columbian population size, (ii) their per capita land use, (iii) the post-1492 population loss, (iv) the resulting carbon uptake of the abandoned anthropogenic landscapes, and then compare these to potential natural drivers of global carbon declines of 7e10 ppm. From 119 published regional population estimates we calculate a pre-1492 CE population of 60.5 million (interquartile range, IQR 44.8e78.2 million), utilizing 1.04 ha land per capita (IQR 0.98e1.11). European epidemics removed 90\% (IQR 87e92\%) of the indigenous population over the next century. This resulted in secondary succession of 55.8 Mha (IQR 39.0e78.4 Mha) of abandoned land, sequestering 7.4 Pg C (IQR 4.9e10.8 Pg C), equivalent to a decline in atmospheric CO2 of 3.5 ppm (IQR 2.3e5.1 ppm CO2). Accounting for carbon cycle feedbacks plus LUC outside the Americas gives a total 5 ppm CO2 additional uptake into the land surface in the 1500s compared to the 1400s, 47 e67\% of the atmospheric CO2 decline. Furthermore, we show that the global carbon budget of the 1500s cannot be balanced until large-scale vegetation regeneration in the Americas is included. The Great Dying of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas resulted in a human-driven global impact on the Earth System in the two centuries prior to the Industrial Revolution.},

In such sentences, the assertion strength of the slifted clause (the non-parenthetical part of the sentence) is modulated by the parenthetical, which provides evidential support (Urmson in Mind 61(244):480\textendash 496, 1952; Asher in J Semant 17:31\textendash 50, 2000; Rooryck in Glot Int 5(4):125\textendash 133, 2001; Jayez and Rossari in: Corblin, de Swart (eds) Handbook of French semantics, CSLI, Stanford, 2004; Davis et al. in Proc Semant Linguist Theory 17:71\textendash 88, 2007; Simons in Lingua 117:1034\textendash 1056, 2007; Murray in Semant Pragmat 7(2):1\textendash 53, 2014; Maier and Bary in: Brochhagen et al.

Starting with the idea that assertability comes in degrees (Lewis in Philos Rev 85:297\textendash 315, 1976; Davis et al. in Proc Semant Linguist Theory 17:71\textendash 88, 2007), this paper develops a probabilistic updatemodel that captures the role of parentheticality as a language tool for qualifying commitments. A crucial role here is played by the rule of Jeffrey conditionalization (Jeffrey in The logic of decision, The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1990), which factors in the uncertainty of the parenthetical information itself. The model also derives certain effects of parenthetical modification not found in regular embedding constructions, including the fact that slifting parentheticals are limited to creating upward-entailing environments.},

  abstract = {Shiwiar is a language spoken by around 1,200 people in the Amazonian lowlands of eastern Ecuador and northern Peru. It belongs to the Chicham (Jivaroan) language family. This work is the first grammatical description of the language, and it is based on a 30-hour audio-visual corpus of natural speech, collected over 12 months of fieldwork between 2011 and 2016 in the Pastaza province of Ecuador. 00The first half of the volume deals primarily with the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of this work. Special emphasis is given to the value of using natural language data for linguistic analysis, and the importance of committing to a high standard of transparency and resolvability with regards to the data. To set the scene, the Shiwiar language is placed within its broader typological, areal and sociocultural context, with special attention to the role of multilingualism and language contact in the region. 00In the second half of the book, an analysis of Shiwiar phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and information structure is presented. Some of the most salient and typologically interesting phenomena described include the high degree of phonetic and phonological variability in the speech community, a rare type of differential object marking, a rich paradigm of pronominal indexing on the verb, and the extensive use of clause chains as a discursive and clause combining device. This book not only provides an analysis of the major linguistic structures in Shiwiar, but it also engages with the areal and typological literature to shed light on their diachronic development.},

  pages = {25},
  abstract = {This paper proposes that co-speech gesture constitutes a type of semantic data that can be used when investigating particular semantic phenomena, to provide additional clues about the semantics of elicited utterances. Drawing from data that involve video recordings of an elicitation session exploring aspect in Crow, a Siouan language of Montana, USA, we employ discourse analysis and gesture analysis to examine the discursive practices and patterns (verbal and nonverbal) of the linguist and the consultant. The claim is that during semantic elicitation, consultants sometimes employ gestures as an embodied resource to concretize and convey abstract grammatical notions, such as aspect. As such, clues to the semantics of the consultant's speech may also be found within the gestural component, and documenting and analyzing gestures that are co-produced with speech can be a useful addition to a semantic fieldworker's toolkit.},

While the literature suggests that such syncretic markers develop through extension from a cislocative (venitive/ventive) to a speech act participant index, the evidence presented here indicates that this development has gone the other way in Karbi (TibetoBurman). This suggests that neither cislocative nor non-subject speech act participant indexation is more primary, but that they share an equally basic idea of orientation towards and therefore impact on the deictic center.},

This questions central assumptions from previous accounts about the functional motivation underlying inverse systems, and suggests that strategies of avoiding overt reference may be at play. The diachronic pathway proposed here connects the traditional inverse with other special marking patterns that involve speech act participant objects, in particular the ``pseudo-inverse'' construction of innovative first person object indexation.},

  abstract = {This is the eighth volume of North East Indian Linguistics, a series of volumes for publishing current research on the languages of North East India, the first volume of which was published in 2008. The papers in this volume were presented at the 9th conference of the North East Indian Linguistics Society (NEILS), held at Tezpur University in February 2016. The papers for this anniversary volume are arranged into five sections, commencing with two field reports on Mnar, a Khasian language, and Liangmai, a "Naga" language of the Zeme group. The second section of the volume presents detailed work on three languages spoken in Arunachal Pradesh, including on the phonology of Hrusso Aka, colour terms in the Tangsa languages of Changlang district, and a sociolinguistic study of language attitudes in a group of Nocte people who have shifted from their ancestral villages to Bordumsa town. The third section explores the morphosyntax of languages in the family now known both by its older name - Sino-Tibetan - and the more recently coined Trans-Himalayan, with papers investigating the grammars of the Kuki-Chin languages of the 'Naga Belt', and Bodo and Dimasa of the Bodo-Garo group of languages. An exciting feature of the 9th NEILS conference was the number of papers on the topic of person indexation (agreement) on verbs, and the fourth section of this volume presents detailed analyses of this topic in a range of languages, particularly from Northern Naga and Kuki-Chin. The final section of the volume covers the study of Assamese, the major language of the area that is an Indo-European language with a long written history. Papers in this section encompass a wide range of topics, including dictionary making, classifiers and quantifiers - an area of syntax that is special to the Eastern Indic area, and language attitudes and changing linguistic forms in the speech of younger Assamese speakers.},

Another factor that could shape lexical selection is word accessibility, or how easy it is to produce a given word (e.g., cat is more accessible than kitten). To test whether producers are also influenced by word accessibility, we designed an artificial lexicon containing high- and low-frequency words whose meanings correspond to compass directions. Participants in a communication game (total N = 181 adults) earned points by producing compass directions, which often required an implicit decision between a high- and low-frequency word. A trade-off was observed across four experiments; specifically, high-frequency words were produced even when less aligned with messages. These results suggest that implicit decisions between words are impacted by accessibility. Of all the times that people have produced cat, sometimes they likely meant kitten.},

Specifically, the tendency towards economy of expression, preferred by a speaker, and the tendency towards semantic transparency, preferred by a listener, were examined in the broader context of the creative potential of an individual, understood as divergent thinking abilities captured by the Torrance test of creative thinking (TTCT). The results indicate that divergent thinking abilities, as operationalized by the TTCT scores, negatively correlate with the general tendency to coin new complex words in a more economical fashion. More specifically, the general tendency towards economy of expression correlates negatively with Elaboration, Creative Strengths, and potentially with Creativity. A more detailed analysis indicates that this is especially the case for the word-formation task, where open-ended responses were analyzed and a drawing served as stimulus material for word formation. These results are not only novel but also encouraging for future research into the role of psychological factors in the psycholinguistic process of word formation conceived as a creative act of a language user.},

We use communities \textendash{} closely knit groups \textendash{} of the lexicon to provide evidence for the existence and coexistence of different connections. We search for communities in the database using two different algorithms, enabling us to see the overlapping (a word belongs to multiple communities) and non-overlapping (a word belongs to only one community) community structures. Our results show that the network of the lexicon is organized by semantic, phonetic, syntactic and grammatical connections, but encyclopedic knowledge and individual experiences are also shaping the associative structure. We also show that words may be connected not just by one, but more types of connections at the same time.},

The typology of attributive constructions is argued to constitute a continuum, from syntactically loose nominal expressions, on the one hand, to morphologically complex structures which are ambiguous between compounding and derivation, on the other hand. The latter involves the use of lexico-grammatical means such as classifiers. The paper also raises the question of a possible diachronic link \textendash{} at least for some languages \textendash{} between intransitive clauses and postnominal property terms, which are often verbal in nature.},

The second part defends a view of word classes as essentially distributional form classes which are defined by the fact that they do not correlate exactly with ontological categories (`things', `actions', and the like) or the discourse functions of reference and predication. The third part, finally, explores the interrelationship between grammaticisation processes and word classes, noting among other things that while grammaticisation processes by definition involve class formation, they rarely bring about large and extensive classes such as the widely used major classes noun, verb, and adjective.},

We manually audit the quality of 205 language-specific corpora released with five major public datasets (CCAligned, ParaCrawl, WikiMatrix, OSCAR, mC4). Lower-resource corpora have systematic issues: At least 15 corpora have no usable text, and a significant fraction contains less than 50\% sentences of acceptable quality. In addition, many are mislabeled or use nonstandard/ambiguous language codes. We demonstrate that these issues are easy to detect even for non-proficient speakers, and supplement the human audit with automatic analyses. Finally, we recommend techniques to evaluate and improve multilingual corpora and discuss potential risks that come with low-quality data releases.},

Very few models have addressed the role of prosodic phrasing in speech planning, and little experimental work examining this question has been conducted so far. Four studies designed to investigate the effect of phrase length and prosodic phrasing on speech planning are presented. The first experiment examines the effect of prosodic structural complexity on pause duration using very long phrases (28 syllables). In a second experiment the effect of prosodic structural complexity using phrases of different length (6, 10, 14 syllables) is investigated. Experiment 3 examines the effect of prosodic complexity when the utterances are strings of numbers and Experiment 4 examines local and distant effects of prosodic phrase length on pause duration. The results show that speakers have a large scope of planning and that both local and distant prosodic phrases have an effect on the speech planning process. It is argued that prosodic structure determines the chunk to be planned by speakers. Implications for models of speech production are discussed.},

Relatively little is known about what factors play a role in determining the duration of pauses between utterances or phrases. Two experiments examining the effect of prosodic structure and phrase length on pause duration are reported. Subjects read sentences varying along the following parameters: (a) the length in syllables of the intonation phrase (IP) preceding and following the pause, and (b) the prosodic structure of the IP preceding and following the pause, specifically whether or not the IP branches into smaller phrases. In order to minimize variability due to speech rate and individual differences, speakers read sentences synchronously in dyads. The results showed a significant postboundary effect of prosodic branching and significant pre and postboundary phrase length effects. The results are discussed in terms of production units.},

Two experiments investigate these questions. An articulatory kinematic experiment examines the effects of structural differences between IP boundaries on the production of those boundaries. In a perception experiment listeners then evaluate the strength of the junctures occurring in the utterances produced in the production study. The results of the studies provide support for the existence of prosodic strength differences among IP boundaries and also demonstrate a close link between the production and perception of prosodic boundaries.

The study presents evidence for morpho-syntactic variation and complexification in the contact varieties of the local languages, Marathi and Kannada. Similar patterns of variation are adduced from contact varieties of Marathi and Kannada from historical data as well as present-day border villages which, like Kupwar, have been traditionally bilingual. The synchronic and historical data point out methodological and theoretical limitations of the original study. The variation and complexity observed in the Kupwar varieties allow for a reconsideration of the notion of intertranslatability or isomorphism in convergence areas. While suggesting a possible geographically defined microlinguistic area at the Marathi-Kannada frontier, the paper indicates that the recent re-drawing of state boundaries along linguistic lines may have initiated divergence in this convergence area.},

Standard Jinghpaw has played an important role in Tibeto-Burman historical-comparative linguistics due to its phonological conservativeness. The loss of final velars is one notable exception, and recognizing this phenomenon enables us to identify and establish more cognate sets between Jinghpaw and closely related languages that provide a basis for a more robust reconstruction of proto-languages. The irregular loss of protofinal velars also provides some implications for the internal classification of Jinghpaw.},

Populations from the Indonesian archipelago played an especially important role because linguistic evidence suggests that the Malagasy language branches from the Southeast Barito language family of southern Borneo, Indonesia, with the closest language spoken today by the Ma'anyan. To test for a genetic link between Malagasy and these linguistically related Indonesian populations, we studied the Ma'anyan and other Indonesian ethnic groups (including the sea nomad Bajo) that, from their historical and linguistic contexts, may be modern descendants of the populations that helped enact the settlement of Madagascar. Result: A combination of phylogeographic analysis of genetic distances, haplotype comparisons and inference of parental populations by linear optimization, using both maternal and paternal DNA lineages, suggests that Malagasy derive from multiple regional sources in Indonesia, with a focus on eastern Borneo, southern Sulawesi and the Lesser Sunda islands. Conclusion: Settlement may have been mediated by ancient sea nomad movements because the linguistically closest population, Ma'anyan, has only subtle genetic connections to Malagasy, whereas genetic links with other sea nomads are more strongly supported. Our data hint at a more complex scenario for the Indonesian settlement of Madagascar than has previously been recognized.},

More precisely, the claim is made that of all verb grammatical morphemes, i.e. prefixes, suffixes, infixes, stem change, reduplication, auxiliaries, etc., it is auxiliary grams that present the clearest case of what is here regarded as metaphoric-metonymic iconicity.},

Predicate derivations in the Tani languages: root, suffix, both or neither? In Mark Post \& Stephen Morey (eds.), North East Indian linguistics, 175\textendash 197. New Delhi: Cambridge University Press India). I argue that these constructions in Thulung are built on grammaticalized elements that can be synchronically considered to be derivational. I focus on their morphology, placing it within the context of simplex verbs, and highlighting certain features \textendash{} multiple exponence, allomorphy of the derivational suffixes similar to that of simplex verbs \textendash{} which suggest strongly a development from serial verb constructions. I discuss their functions, which cover valence changes, as well as the marking of associated motion and aspect/Aktionsart. Complex predicates are seen as a feature of South Asian languages, but the types found in Tibeto-Burman languages appear to be quite different, morphologically, from what is found in Indo-Aryan or Dravidian languages. This article therefore represents a language-specific description as a contribution to cross-linguistic research on the topic.},

The analysis suggests a closer genetic relationship between Tangut and Modern West Gyalrongic than between Tangut and Modern East Gyalrongic.

We investigate how compensation processes driven by lexical and coarticulatory contexts simultaneously affect listeners' perception of a single segment and the individual differences in the compensation patterns. Sibilants on an /s-{$\Elzesh$}/ continuum were embedded into four lexical frames that differed in whether the lexical context favored /s/ or /{$\Elzesh$}/ perceptually and whether the vocalic context favored /s/ or not. Forty-two participants took a lexical decision task to decide whether each stimulus was a word or not. They also completed the autism-spectrum quotient questionnaire. The aggregate results of the lexical decision task show coexistence of lexically induced and coarticulatorily induced perceptual shifts in parallel. A negative correlation was found between the two kinds of perceptual shifts for individual listeners in lexical decisions, lending support to a potential trade-off between compensation magnitudes on different levels of cue integration.},

The team conducted sociolinguistic interviews to assess vitality, used self-evaluation questionnaires to evaluate proficiency in Dobu and English, and elicited wordlists for lexicostatistical comparison. Four distinct dialects (Galeya, Basima, Ulua, and Gameta) were identified, but all four dialects can reportedly understand the central Basima dialect. The Galeya language appears to be vital, and there are educated individuals in the area who could potentially be involved in language development.},

A "classical constituent" emerges \"as a special case when a particular kind of conceptual group happens to be symbolized by a particular kind of phonological group.

The tests are not genuinely designed by the author but collected from various linguistic investigations on such constructions. As the concept of support verb construction spans across a wide variety of languages, most tests can be applied to several languages. In the article, examples are given for French, English and German. It will be shown that most of the tests that cover the grammaticality of syntactic or semantic transformations of verb\textendash noun constructions only present an approximation of underlying semantic properties and that to almost each alleged property exceptions can be found. However, taken as a whole, the test battery seems to be suitable to delineate support verb constructions from superficially similar linguistic expressions.},

  abstract = {Among the Tibeto-Burman languages the importance of the marking of transitivity varies greatly, from transitivity not being a very useful concept at all to being extremely important to the understanding of the morphology of the language. In this paper an example of the latter type is discussed, the Rawang language of northern Myanmar (Burma). In this language all verbs are clearly distinguished (even in citation) in terms of transitivity by their morphology, and there are a number of different affixes for increasing or decreasing valency. A very interesting phenomenon related to the importance of transitivity differences that occurs in Rawang is the phenomenon of what I call ``transitivity harmony''. All auxiliary verbs in this language are transitive, and when they appear with a transitive main verb, they simply follow that verb and the two verbs together take one set of transitive-marking morphology. If instead the main verb is intransitive, then the auxiliary verb must be made intransitive by the reflexive/middle voice suffix to harmonize with the intransitive verb. This pattern holds even when the main verb is overtly nominalized. Aside from establishing transitivity harmony as a typological phenomenon, this paper will also discuss some of the motivations for such a pattern of marking and its significance for understanding event profiling.},

This tradition is still alive, but was sidelined and even denigrated for many years due to the rise of Structuralism, which attempted to study language structures divorced from their linguistic and socio-cultural contexts. The paper reviews the understandings the early scholars had and points out their similarities with cutting edge current views in cognitive linguistics, construction grammar, and interactional linguistics, which had to be rediscovered due to the influence of Structuralism for so many years. It then argues that we should make linguistic typology (and linguistics more generally) more modern, scientific, and empirical by returning to our roots.},

There is only one copula verb in Qiang, which can be used in equational, identificational, attributive, naming, and cleft constructions, as well as one type of possessive construction. There are five existential verbs in Qiang, the use of which depends on the semantics of the referent being predicated as existing and its location. The existential verbs have a number of the characteristics of adjective-like stative verbs, and can be modified by adverbs of degree, but they cannot directly modify nouns. Also, the meaning of reduplication of existential verbs is different from that of adjective-like stative verbs: reduplication of existential verbs results in transitivization, while reduplication of adjective-like stative verbs results in emphasis of degree.},

Specifically, the realization of a modal-breathy voice quality contrast is analyzed through observing the effects of language ability and usage-related sociolinguistic factors. The results show increased usage of F0 and CPP cues in production and of F0 cues in perception of the voice quality contrast with greater ability and usage of a tonal language. Tonal language ability and usage also affects other acoustic correlates of voice quality, but does not uniformly weaken them. Degree of integration into Thai society shows mixed effects, only somewhat correlating with decay of voice quality cues. The results have bearing on the role of larger national and regional languages in restructuring of phonological contrasts and in phonological attrition, and provide insight into the relationship between multilingualism and sound change.},

  abstract = {Some word-order alternations observed across the world's languages are constrained by specific verb choice, whereas one type of word-order alternation (i.e., scrambling) frequently seen in free word order languages is not lexically-dependent on the verb. Three novel-language learning experiments explore whether speakers latently respect this generalization. If learners show conservativeness that closely reflects statistics from the input, then it would support usage-based and statistical accounts; alternatively, if learners have linguistic biases that allow them to generalize beyond statistics and show generalization similar to typological patterns, then it would support an internal bias account. In each of the three experiments, two groups of English monolinguals learned a Korean-English hybrid language with structural alternations analogous to those found in different categories of natural languages, as defined by whether the language allows scrambling and whether alternations are lexicallydependent on the verb. Learners' generalization patterns in subsequent picture description and acceptability judgment tasks were analyzed. Comprehension data consistently showed that the group which learned alter\- nations found in natural languages with relatively rigid word orders tended to be more verb-wise conservative than the group that learned alternations found in languages with relatively free word orders. Production data trended in the same direction as the comprehension data. Thus, our results suggest that learners have linguistic biases that mirror typological differences that help learners go beyond simple statistics tracking.},

We will then examine the reality of the clause in everyday talk in these languages quantitatively and qualitatively; in our qualitative analysis, we focus in particular on what units are oriented to by conversational participants. The current study suggests that the degree of grammaticization of the clause varies crosslinguistically and questions the central theoretical status accorded to this structural unit.},

To better isolate the impact that volunteering has on people's wellbeing, we explore nationally representative UK household datasets with an extensive longitudinal component, to run panel analysis which controls for the previous higher or lower levels of SWB that volunteers report. Using first-difference estimation within the British Household Panel Survey and Understanding Society longitudinal panel datasets (10 waves spanning about 20 years), we are able to control for higher prior levels of wellbeing of those who volunteer, and to produce the most robust quasi-causal estimates to date by ensuring that volunteering is associated not just with a higher wellbeing a priori, but with a positive change in wellbeing. Comparison of equivalent wellbeing values from previous studies shows that our analysis is the most realistic and conservative estimate to date of the association between volunteering and subjective wellbeing, and its equivalent wellbeing value of \textsterling 911 per volunteer per year on average to compensate for the wellbeing increase associated with volunteering. It is our hope that these values can be incorporated into decision-making at the policy and practitioner level, to ensure that the societal benefits provided by volunteering are better understood and internalised into decisions.},

Extended roots show properties associated with `pluractional' verbs attested crosslinguistically; in particular, they are associated with both plural participant and iterative interpretations. However, they differ from typical pluractionals in the following two ways: (i) they are not morphologically formed on the basis of their restricted counterparts (which are associated with singular, punctual readings) and (ii) they are compatible with numeric modifiers. I propose that these differences can be understood under the proposal that all pluractionals obligatorily involve two components which are always distinctly represented in the semantics\textemdash PL(ural) and DEG(ree). The latter contributes a large quantity (as opposed to a simple plural) reading. However, languages vary with respect to whether these two can form a single syntactic unit (and hence be bundled into a single morpheme). This predicts a simple typology in which only a subset of so-called pluractional verbs yield a necessarily large quantity reading.},

  abstract = {Baba Malay encodes a coarse-refined contrast in speech styles, with the vowel [{$\varepsilon$}] being traditionally restricted to the use of refined word forms. Coarse forms ending with [al], [a{$\Elzfhr$}], and [as] contrast with refined forms that end with [{$\varepsilon$}], which are used when the speaker wants to be perceived as being particularly refined. A comparison of natural conversational speech with careful performative speech supports the claim that speakers of endangered languages are not ``monostylistic''. Production data from eight speakers across different age groups show that the [{$\varepsilon$}] forms more commonly occur in the careful performative speech of younger speakers, as compared to when they converse more informally. No such trend is established for older speakers. The production data is considered together with the findings of a previously-executed matchedguise experiment, which shows that younger speakers in particular are reanalyzing the refined forms as being emblematic of community identity. In this study, younger speakers appear to be using [{$\varepsilon$}] to index an ideal speaker of Baba Malay in their careful performative speech. The research highlights that speakers of endangered languages, and even members of the younger generation, do have access to multiple styles.},

  abstract = {Painting has played a major role in human expression, evolving subject to a complex interplay of representational conventions, social interactions, and a process of historization. From individual qualitative work of art historians emerges a metanarrative that remains difficult to evaluate in its validity regarding emergent macroscopic and underlying microscopic dynamics. The full scope of granular data, the summary statistics, and consequently, also their bias simply lie beyond the cognitive limit of individual qualitative human scholarship. Yet, a more quantitative understanding is still lacking, driven by a lack of data and a persistent dominance of qualitative scholarship in art history. Here, we show that quantitative analyses of creative processes in landscape painting can shed light, provide a systematic verification, and allow for questioning the emerging metanarrative. Using a quasicanonical benchmark dataset of 14,912 landscape paintings, covering a period from the Western renaissance to contemporary art, we systematically analyze the evolution of compositional proportion via a simple yet coherent information-theoretic dissection method that captures iterations of the dominant horizontal and vertical partition directions. Tracing frequency distributions of seemingly preferred compositions across several conceptual dimensions, we find that dominant dissection ratios can serve as a meaningful signature to capture the unique compositional characteristics and systematic evolution of individual artist bodies of work, creation date time spans, and conventional style periods, while concepts of artist nationality remain problematic. Network analyses of individual artists and style periods clarify their rhizomatic confusion while uncovering three distinguished yet nonintuitive supergroups that are meaningfully clustered in time.},

On the other hand, for a sign to be grammaticalized means for it to acquire functions in the analytic formation of more comprehensive signs.

In this, it is comparable to such processes as the transitivization of a verbal base, which further specifies a relatively rough categorization. Languages differ both in the extent to which they structure the material by purely grammatical criteria and in the level at which they do this. The root and the stem are the lowest levels at which a linguistic sign can be categorized in terms of language-specific structure. Further categorization is then achieved at the level of the syntagm.             An empirical investigation comparing the categorization of roots and stems in a sample of six languages (English, German, Latin, Spanish, Yucatec Maya, Mandarin Chinese) turns up far-reaching differences. These differences in the amount of categorization that languages apply to linguistic signs at the most basic levels throw into doubt any thesis claiming universal categoriality or acategoriality for roots. Such a static view must be replaced by a dynamic one which asks for the role of categorization in linguistic activity. At the same time, these differences raise the issue of the amount of structure \textemdash{} or of grammar \textemdash{} that is necessary for a human language.1},

  abstract = {Univerbation is the syntagmatic condensation of a sequence of words recurrent in discourse into one word, as when the Spanish combination a tras (to back) becomes atr\'as `behind'. It affects both lexemes and grammatical formatives. Unlike processes of word formation, including conversion of a syntactic construction into a word, as in forget-me-not, and compounding, as in Spanish lavaplatos `dishwasher', univerbation is a spontaneous process. There are two main types of univerbation: phrasal univerbation downgrades a phrase to a word, as when Latin terrae motus `earth's movement' becomes Spanish terremoto `earthquake'. Transgressive univerbation coalesces a string of words which do not form a syntagma into a word, as when French par ce que becomes parce que. A set of univerbations may share structural features and may therefore evolve into a pattern of compounding. Thus, blackbird originated by univerbation, but may now provide a pattern of compounding. As a consequence, univerbation and compounding are not always easily distinguishable. The discussion uses empirical evidence adduced in earlier work, mostly from Romance and Germanic languages. Its aim is not to present novel phenomena but to provide a theoretical background for the phenomenology and improve on available analyses.},

We characterise the occurrence of these problems in the different societal types and enquire into the main force keeping societies together given the prevalence of these. To address this, we consider the social problems in light of the theory of repeated games, and delineate the role of intertemporal incentives in sustaining cooperative behaviour through the reciprocity principle. We analyse the population, economic and political structural features of the five societal types, and show that intertemporal incentives have been adapted to the changes in scope and scale of the core social problems as societies have grown in size. In all societies, reciprocity mechanisms appear to solve the social problems by enabling lifetime direct benefits to individuals for cooperation. Our analysis leads us to predict that as societies increase in complexity, they need more of the following four features to enable the scalability and adaptability of the reciprocity principle: nested grouping, decentralised enforcement and local information, centralised enforcement and coercive power, and formal rules.},

Although their verbal and vocal characteristics have been deeply analysed, few studies have provided a qualified picture of their vocal integration. Beyond showing that secondary constructions are not evenly dependent on their environment, the results suggest that prosody demarcates secondary constructions more than it integrates them. The creation of a break preferentially takes place retrospectively, immediately after the subordinate structure through rhythmic features and/or pitch upsteps.},

Extended into an entropy rate, it gives bounds in coding and compression theorems. In this paper, I describe how statistical entropy and entropy rate relate to other notions of entropy that are relevant to probability theory (entropy of a discrete probability distribution measuring its unevenness), computer sciences (algorithmic complexity), the ergodic theory of dynamical systems (Kolmogorov\textendash Sinai or metric entropy) and statistical physics (Boltzmann entropy). Their mathematical foundations and correlates (the entropy concentration, Sanov, Shannon\textendash McMillan\textendash Breiman, Lempel\textendash Ziv and Pesin theorems) clarify their interpretation and offer a rigorous basis for maximum entropy principles. Although often ignored, these mathematical perspectives give a central position to entropy and relative entropy in statistical laws describing generic collective behaviours, and provide insights into the notions of randomness, typicality and disorder. The relevance of entropy beyond the realm of physics, in particular for living systems and ecosystems, is yet to be demonstrated.},

We propose that languages spoken by larger communities adapt and overcome these greater barriers by increasing their reliance on sound symbolism, as sound symbolism can facilitate communication. To test whether widely spoken languages are more sound symbolic, participants listened to recordings of the words big and small in widely spoken and less common languages and guessed their meanings. Accuracy was higher for words from widely spoken languages providing evidence that widely spoken languages harbor more sound symbolism. Preliminary results also suggest that widely spoken languages rely on different sound symbolic patterns than less common languages. Community size can thus shape linguistic forms and influence the tools that languages use to facilitate communication.},

  abstract = {Making a self-repair in speech typically proceeds in three phases. The first phase involves the monitoring of one's own speech and the interruption of the flow of speech when trouble is detected. From an analysis of 959 spontaneous self-repairs it appears that interrupting follows detection promptly, with the exception that correct words tend to be completed. Another finding is that detection of trouble improves towards the end of constituents. The second phase is characterized by hesitation,pausing, but especially the use of so-called editing terms. Which editing term is used depends on the nature of the speech trouble in a rather regular fashion: Speech errors induce other editing terms than words thatare merely inappropriate, and trouble which is detected quickly by the speaker is preferably signalled by the use of `uh'. The third phase consistsof making the repair proper. The linguisticwell-formedness of a repair is not dependent on the speaker's respecting the integriv of constituents, but on the structural relation between original utterance and repair. A bi-conditional well-formedness rule links this relation to a corresponding relation between the conjuncts of a coordination. It is suggested that a similar relation holds also between question and answer. In all three cases the speaker respects certain Istructuralcommitments derived from an original utterance. It was finally shown that the editing term plus the first word of the repair proper almost alwayscontain sufficient informationfor the listener to decide how the repair should be related to the original utterance. Speakers almost never produce misleading information in this respect. It is argued thatspeakers have littleor no access to their speech production process; self-monitoring is probably based on parsing one's own inner or overt speech.},

The terms are nouns, which display complex patterns of suppletion in possessive and locative uses. Many of the terms are compounds, many unanalysable. Semantically, visible body parts divide into three main types: (i) a partonomic subsystem dividing the body into nine major parts: head, neck, two upper limbs, trunk, two upper legs, two lower legs, (ii) designated surfaces (e.g. `lower belly'), (iii) collections of surface features (`face'), (iv) taxonomic subsystems (e.g. `big toe' being a kind of `toe'). With regards to (i), the lack of any designation for `foot' or `hand' is notable, as is the absence of a term for `leg' as a whole (although this is a lexical not a conceptual gap, as shown by the alternate taboo vocabulary). Ye\textasciiacute l\textasciicircum\i{} Dnye body part terms do not have major extensions to other domains (e.g. spatial relators). Indeed, a number of the terms are clearly borrowed from outside human biology (e.g. `wing butt' for shoulder).},

This point is illustrated by several quantitative studies of word order variation, which can be measured as entropy at different levels of granularity. I argue that this variation can be explained by general functional mechanisms and pressures, which manifest themselves in language use, such as optimization of processing (including avoidance of ambiguity) and grammaticalization of predictable units occurring in chunks.

Cue availability serves as a measure of markedness, whereas cue reliability is central for the efficiency account. Similar to reverse engineering, we determine which of the probabilistic measures could have been responsible for the recurrent cross-linguistic patterns described in the literature. The probabilities are estimated from spontaneous informal dialogues in English and Russian (Indo-European), Lao (Tai-Kadai), N||ng (Tuu) and Ruuli (Bantu). The analyses, which involve a series of mixed-effects Poisson models, clearly demonstrate that cue reliability matches the observed cross-linguistic patterns better than cue availability.

  abstract = {Cross-linguistic studies focus on inverse correlations (trade-offs) between linguistic variables that reflect different cues to linguistic meanings. For example, if a language has no case marking, it is likely to rely on word order as a cue for identification of grammatical roles. Such inverse correlations are interpreted as manifestations of language users' tendency to use language efficiently. The present study argues that this interpretation is problematic. Linguistic variables, such as the presence of case, or flexibility of word order, are aggregate properties, which do not represent the use of linguistic cues in context directly. Still, such variables can be useful for circumscribing the potential role of communicative efficiency in language evolution, if we move from cross-linguistic trade-offs to multivariate causal networks. This idea is illustrated by a case study of linguistic variables related to four types of Subject and Object cues: case marking, rigid word order of Subject and Object, tight semantics and verb-medial order. The variables are obtained from online language corpora in thirty languages, annotated with the Universal Dependencies. The causal model suggests that the relationships between the variables can be explained predominantly by sociolinguistic factors, leaving little space for a potential impact of efficient linguistic behavior.},

At the same time, the use of corpora for typological purposes has not only advantages and opportunities, but also numerous challenges.

The present study examines a more diverse sample of languages than the previous studies (Arabic, Finnish, Hungarian, Indonesian, Russian, Spanish and Turkish). I use large web-based corpora from the Leipzig Corpora Collection to estimate word lengths in UTF-8 characters and in phonemes (for some of the languages), as well as word frequency, informativity given previous word and informativity given next word, applying different methods of bigrams processing. The results show different correlations between word length and the corpus-based measure for different languages. I argue that these differences can be explained by the properties of noun phrases in a language, most importantly, by the order of heads and modifiers and their relative morphological complexity, as well as by orthographic conventions.},

The second part focuses on proximity maps based on Multidimensional Scaling and compares the most important semantic distinctions, which are inferred from a parallel corpus of film subtitles and from grammar descriptions. The results suggest that corpus-based maps of tokens are more sensitive to cultural and genre-related differences in the prominence of specific causation scenarios than maps based on constructional types, which are described in reference grammars. The grammar-based maps also reveal a less clear structure, which can be due to incomplete semantic descriptions in grammars. Therefore, each approach has its shortcomings, which researchers need to be aware of.},

We focus on A-lability, when the A argument alternates with S (e.g., She is singing vs. She is singing a song), and P-lability, when the P-argument alternates with S (e.g., She opened the door vs. The door opened). To estimate how much lability is observed in a language, we measure associations between Verbs or Verb + Noun combinations and the alternating constructions in which they occur. Our correlational analyses show that high P-lability scores correlate strongly with the following parameters: little or no case marking; weaker associations between lexemes and the grammatical roles A and P; rigid order of Subject and Object; and a high proportion of verb-medial clauses (SVO). Low P-lability correlates with the presence of case marking, stronger associations between nouns and grammatical roles, relatively flexible ordering of Subject and Object, and verb-final order. As for A-lability, it is not correlated with any other parameters. A possible reason is that A-lability is a result of more universal discourse processes, such as deprofiling of the object, and also exhibits numerous lexical and semantic idiosyncrasies. The fact that P-lability is strongly correlated with other parameters can be interpreted as evidence for a more general typology of languages, in which some have highly informative morphosyntactic and lexical cues, whereas others rely predominantly on contextual environment, which is enabled by fixed word order. We also find that P-lability is more strongly correlated with the other parameters than any of these parameters are with each other, which means that it can be a very useful typological variable.},

The question is how much two related constructions should overlap semantically and pragmatically in order to be used for the purposes of efficient communication. The case study focuses on want to \th{} Infinitive and its reduced variant with wanna, which have different stylistic and sociolinguistic connotations. Bayesian mixed-effects regression modelling based on the spoken part of the British National Corpus reveals a very limited effect of efficiency: predictability increases the chances of the reduced variant only in fast speech. We conclude that efficient use of more and less effortful variants is restricted when two variants are associated with different registers or styles. This paper also pursues a methodological goal regarding missing values in speech corpora. We impute missing data based on the existing values. A comparison of regression models with and without imputed values reveals similar tendencies. This means that imputation is useful for dealing with missing values in corpora.},

In particular, information-theoretic and psycholinguistic considerations suggest that this may include maximizing the uniformity of information density in an utterance. We investigate this possibility in the context of syntactic reduction, where the speaker has the option of either marking a higher-order unit (a phrase) with an extra word, or leaving it unmarked. We demonstrate that speakers are more likely to reduce less information-dense phrases. In a second step, we combine a stochastic model of structured utterance production with a logistic-regression model of syntactic reduction to study which types of cues speakers employ when estimating the predictability of upcoming elements. We demonstrate that the trend toward predictability-sensitive syntactic reduction (Jaeger, 2006) is robust in the face of a wide variety of control variables, and present evidence that speakers use both surface and structural cues for predictability estimation.},

In Experiment 1, participants produced high-effort (e.g., yelling) and low-effort (e.g., chatting) words that are semantically related to articulation, as well as words that are semantically unrelated to articulation (e.g., kicking). We found that vocal words were produced with greater intensity than non-vocal words. In Experiment 2, we explored the specificity of this effect by investigating how words semantically related to the mouth, but unrelated to vocalization (e.g., chewing) were articulated. Analyses revealed that mouth words did not differ from controls, and we replicated the vocal effects from Experiment 1, suggesting fine-grain motor activation from lexical semantics. Experiment 3 revealed that the semantics of a verb influences the prosodic intensity of a sentence prior to the onset of the verb. Together, these data suggest aspects of lexical meaning influence prosody, and that motor representations may underlie lexical semantics.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the evolution of the Chinese verb 断 (du\`an `break'), exploring how the lexicon has transformed from being a substantive transitive verb in the past to the various functions it fulfils in contemporary Chinese: i.e. a resultative complement, an adjective, an adverb and a noun. Findings reveal that du\`an was initially transitive and its intransitive function was derived during the Spring and Autumn period (772\textendash 476 BC). The two functions co-existed for the rest of the Pre-Qin period (before 221 BC). Du\`an's transition into a resultative complement began during the Eastern Han dynasty (AD 25\textendash 220), and its noun function was shaped in the Warring State period (475\textendash 221 BC). Finally, Du\`an's adjective and adverb functions are noted to begin in Middle Chinese (AD 420\textendash 1279). Although some of these transitions took place more or less simultaneously during overlapping periods, they developed via two separate paths: the process by which du\`an developed into a resultative complement, an adverb, and an adjective is that of grammaticalization, while on the other hand, the process by which du\`an developed into a noun is that of lexicalization. Essentially, it is the intransitive function that is subject to grammaticalization and it is the transitive function that is subject to lexicalization. In this paper it is therefore proposed that the above diachronic change is taken as a cline, and is put forward as follows: (a) grammaticalization and lexicalization are not distinct processes but rather happen to a lexeme more or less simultaneously; and (b) interrelationship between the two processes is orthogonal.},

But while the majority of the literature is devoted to the identification of the verb-framed or satellite-framed status of individual languages, relatively little (if any) research focuses on the foundation of this theory. This article addresses the nature of the macro-event, a fundamental concept for the Talmyan two-way typology, proposing a diachronic aspect of the macro-event, an aspect that seems to be under-appreciated or even neglected. It argues that a macro-event results from the integration of two simpler events through grammaticalization in Mandarin. This hypothesis is supported by the behavior of directional complements in Mandarin Chinese in that these directional complements in combination with the main verbs can express all the five types of the macro-events that Talmy has analyzed to establish his typology, and that these macro-events themselves represent an integration of two simpler events and exhibit various degrees of grammaticalization. This study brings together two seemingly unrelated areas of research, that is, the area of event structure and that of grammaticalization, thus providing a new perspective on the Talmyan typological paradigm. The result, though supported by the data in Mandarin Chinese, might have universal value and implications for other languages as well.},

Particularly, it explores how the speaker uses syntax and bodily visual conduct to accomplish the delicate action of negatively assessing others and to solicit the recipient to collaboratively complete negative assessments. Based on an examination of approximately 5 h of everyday Mandarin face-to-face conversations, the study shows that incomplete syntax, facial expressions, and head shakes constitute multimodal practices in making negative assessments of the recipient and a non-present third party. Leaving assessments syntactically incomplete and displaying negative evaluative stance through facial expressions such as lip-pursing and eyebrow furrows and head shakes show the speaker's orientation to the negative assessments as a delicate action. The facial expressions after incomplete syntax demonstrate that participants orient to the hesitation in the delivery of a TCU/turn-in-progress not as production problem, but rather an interactional problem. This study shows that the boundaries of assessment turns may be blurry, and that one assessment may be collaboratively produced by two participants, which exemplifies a specific aspect of weak cesuras and fuzzy boundaries of units and actions in interaction.},

Emotions are conveyed in spoken words via verbal and non-verbal channels that are mutually informative and unveil in parallel over time, but the neural dynamics and interactions of these processes are not well understood. In this paper, we review the literature on emotion perception in faces, written words, and voices, as a basis for understanding the functional organization of emotion perception in spoken words. The characteristics of visual and auditory routes to the amygdala\textemdash a subcortical center for emotion perception\textemdash are compared across these stimulus classes in terms of neural dynamics, hemispheric lateralization, and functionality. Converging results from neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and lesion studies suggest the existence of an afferent route to the amygdala and primary visual cortex for fast and subliminal processing of coarse emotional face cues. We suggest that a fast route to the amygdala may also function for brief non-verbal vocalizations (e.g., laugh, cry), in which emotional category is conveyed effectively by voice tone and intensity. However, emotional prosody which evolves on longer time scales and is conveyed by fine-grained spectral cues appears to be processed via a slower, indirect cortical route. For verbal emotional content, the bulk of current evidence, indicating predominant left lateralization of the amygdala response and timing of emotional effects attributable to speeded lexical access, is more consistent with an indirect cortical route to the amygdala. Top-down linguistic modulation may play an important role for prioritized perception of emotions in words. Understanding the neural dynamics and interactions of emotion and language perception is important for selecting potent stimuli and devising effective training and/or treatment approaches for the alleviation of emotional dysfunction across a range of neuropsychiatric states.},

A class of motion verbs in Mandarin that regularly appears at either V1 or V2 position in the V1+V2 construction is only grammaticalized at the V2 position, where the verb becomes a directional complement. We provide a cognitive semantic account and propose a new hypothesis that we call the syntactic position and event type sensitivity hypothesis in grammaticalization. We analyze corpus data across five historical stages for 11 simplex directional complements. The analysis draws on Talmy's macro-event theory and Lehmann's grammaticalization parameters. It is concluded that motion verbs at the V1 position are most likely to have agentive subjects, which foregrounds the idea of motion in V1, while V2 focuses on the Agent's purpose. Motion verbs at V2 are relatively more likely to have non-agentive subjects, which foregrounds the Path element in V2 and complements the action of V1, rather than the purpose of the Agent. What triggers the grammaticalization of the V2 is the foregrounding of the Path element in V2, which complements the action of V1, and its non-agentive subject.},

Native speakers were recruited to provide comparative data. This data, supplemented by reputable descriptions or field notes, was evaluated against a number of WALS- or WALS-like features, enabling a fine-tuned characterization of each language, taking different linguistic domains into account (phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon). The emerging patterns were compared with global distributions as well as with characteristic IA features and well-known areal patterns. Some features, mainly syntactic, turned out to be shared with IA in general, whereas others do have scattered reflexes in IA outside of the region but are especially prevalent in the region: large consonant inventories, tripartite pronominal case alignment, a high frequency of left-branching constructions, and multi-degree deictic systems. Yet other features display a high degree of diversity, often bundling subareally. Finally, there was a significant clustering of features that are not characterizing IA in general: tripartite affricate differentiation, retroflexion across several subsets, aspiration contrasts involving voiceless consonants only, tonal contrasts and 20-based numerals. This clustering forms a ``hard core'' at the centre of the region, gradually fading out toward its peripheries.},

  abstract = {The Hindu Kush, or the mountain region of northern Pakistan, northeastern Afghanistan and the northern-most part of the Indian-administered Kashmir region, is home to approximately 50 languages belonging to six different genera: IndoAryan, Iranian, Nuristani, Sino-Tibetan, Turkic and the isolate Burushaski. Areality research on this region is only in its early stages, and while its significance as a convergence area has been suggested by several scholars, only a few, primarily phonological and grammatical, features have been studied in a more systematic fashion. Cross-linguistic research in the realms of semantics and lexical organization has been given considerably less attention. However, preliminary findings indicate that features are geographically bundled with one another, across genera, in significant ways, displaying semantic areality on multiple levels throughout the region or in one or more of its sub-regions. The present study is an areal-typological investigation of kinship terms in the region, in which particular attention is paid to a few notable polysemy patterns and what appears to be a significant geographical clustering of these. Comparisons are made between the geographical distribution of such patterns and those of some other linguistic features as well as with relevant non-linguistic factors related to shared cultural values or identities and a long history of small-scale cross-community interaction in different parts of the region.},

Zhuokeji is demonstrated to encode a typological ly prominent aspectual opposition between Perfective and Imperfective as well as a distinction of absolute tense between Present Imperfective and Past Imperfective, with the Perfective usually carrying past-time reference.},

In other words, it will become extinct in a few decades if nothing is done; but it is not too late if the community decides to turn it around, and do so fast. Thus far, the community has shown little interest. Into this situation, vernacular elementary education was introduced. While the community expects this to work for language survival, the aim of the education policy is the eventual transfer of literacy skills to English. This paper describes the tensions between these conflicting goals, and the various components that make up the specific situation of Kuot, including vernacular literacy, orthographic considerations arising from the language's precarious situation, and the eventual extension of the internet era to Melanesia.},

At the same time, the demand for cross-linguistic datasets has been increasing, as witnessed by numerous studies devoted to diverse questions on human prehistory, cultural evolution, and human cognition. Unfortunately, most published datasets lack standardization which makes their comparison difficult. Here, we present a new approach to increase the comparability of cross-linguistic lexical data. We have designed workflows for the computer-assisted lifting of datasets to Cross-Linguistic Data Formats, a collection of standards that make these datasets more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). We test the Lexibank workflow on 100 lexical datasets from which we derive an aggregated database of wordlists in unified phonetic transcriptions covering more than 2000 language varieties. We illustrate the benefits of our approach by showing how phonological and lexical features can be automatically inferred, complementing and expanding existing cross-linguistic datasets.},

  pages = {56},
  abstract = {In this paper we address the long-standing issue of how prosodic patterns are linked to meanings. We explore the idea that prosodically realized communicative functions, such as focus and sentence modality, are analogous to lexical morphemes, the smallest sound units that carry meaning. We considered evidence of a four-way similarity between lexical morphemes and prosodic functions. First, similar to lexical morphemes, each prosodic function consists of multiple phonetic components. Second, like segmental phonemes, individual prosodic components are meaningless themselves, but act jointly to mark both intraand inter-functional contrasts. Third, like lexical morphemes, prosodic functions have allomorph-like variants whose occurrences are conditioned by factors like location in sentence and interaction with other prosodic functions. Finally, similar to lexical morphemes, prosodic functions are language-specific and the specificity has likely historical sources. We examined the evidence by a) reviewing existing literature on speech prosody, b) conducting two new experiments on the production of focus and sentence modality in General American English and Mandarin Chinese, and c) training an articulatory-functional model on focus, modality, tone and stress in English and Mandarin, and synthesizing fully-detailed F0 contours with the learned functional targets. Overall, all the evidence examined is in support of the hypothesis. In particular, the consistency between the target parameters obtained from acoustic analysis and computational modeling, and the close match between functionally synthesized and naturally produced F0 contours demonstrate the plausibility of establishing a clear link between function-specific categorical representations and fine-detailed surface prosody.},

  abstract = {The transcription of covert recordings used as evidence in court is a huge issue for forensic linguistics. Covert recordings are typically made under conditions in which the device needs to be hidden, and so the resulting speech is generally indistinct, with overlapping voices and background noise, and in many cases the acoustic record cannot be analyzed via conventional phonetic techniques (i.e. phonetic segments are unclear, or there are no cues at all present acoustically). In the case of indistinct audio, the resulting transcripts that are produced, often by police working on the case, are often questionable and despite their unreliable nature can be provided as evidence in court. Injustices can, and have, occurred. Given the growing performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies, and growing reliance on such technologies in everyday life, a common question asked, especially by lawyers and other legal professionals, is whether ASR can solve the problem of what was said in indistinct forensic audio, and this is the main focus of the current paper. The paper also looks at forced alignment, a way of automatically aligning an existing transcriptions to audio. This is an area that needs to be explored in the context of forensic linguistics because transcripts can technically be ``aligned'' with any audio, making it seem as if it is ``correct'' even if it is not. The aim of this research is to demonstrate how automatic transcription systems fare using forensic-like audio, and with more than one system. Forensic-like audio is most appropriate for research, because there is greater certainty with what the speech material consists of (unlike in forensic situations where it cannot be verified). Examples of how various ASR systems cope with indistinct audio are shown, highlighting that when a good-quality recording is used ASR systems cope well, with the resulting transcript being usable and, for the most part, accurate. When a poor-quality, forensic-like recording is used, on the other hand, the resulting transcript is effectively unusable, with numerous errors and very few words recognized (and in some cases, no words recognized). The paper also demonstrates some of the problems that arise when forced-alignment is used with indistinct forensic-like audio\textemdash the transcript is simply ``forced'' onto an audio signal giving completely wrong alignment. This research shows that the way things currently stand, computational methods are not suitable for solving the issue of transcription of indistinct forensic audio for a range of reasons. Such systems cannot transcribe what was said in indistinct covert recordings, nor can they determine who uttered the words and phrases in such recordings, nor prove that a transcript is ``right'' (or wrong). These systems can indeed be used advantageously in research, and for various other purposes, and the reasons they do not work for forensic transcription stems from the nature of the recording conditions, as well as the nature of the forensic context.},

This is in part a consequence of the tendency of recent research on the phonological aspect of discourse to limit itself to `intonation' as an area of primary interest. This work has moved away from the type of phonological analysis, such as that of Halliday (1967), that states intonational systems in terms of grammatically defined units or sentence types. Workers such as Brazil (1975, 1978, 1981), Brown, Currie and Kenworthy (1981), and Coulthard and Brazil (1981) have pursued Bolinger's suggestion that the relationship between intonation and grammar is `casual not causal' and have sought to relate `intonation' to discourse categories rather than to grammatical ones. These, and similar attempts to deal with aspects of discourse phonology, have suggested some organizational features which traditional linguistic accounts have not dealt with. On the whole, however, these recent attempts have been less than satisfactory for one or more of the following reasons.},

Here we report on the sequential organisation and phonetic form of abrupt-joins. By abrupt-join we mean to adumbrate a complex of recurrent phonetic events which attend a point of possible turn-completion, and the beginning of an immediately subsequent turn-constructional unit (TCU) produced by that same speaker. In doing an abrupt-join, the speaker can be seen to preempt the transition relevance and interactional implicativeness of the first unit. The phonetic features which constitute this practice include duration, rhythm, pitch, loudness and articulatory characteristics of both the end of the first unit and the beginning of the second. Abrupt-joins are a resource used in the building of a particular kind of multi-unit turn, where each unit performs a discrete action with the abrupt-join marking the juncture between them, with the subsequent talk changing the sequential trajectory projectable from the talk leading up to the abruptjoin. One clear distributional pattern emerges from the data: abrupt-joins occur regularly in closingrelevant and topic-transition sequences.},

FPCA is an analysis of curves, returning the dominant modes of curve variation as functions, called Functional Principal Components (PCs); each input curve receives a coefficient for identified PCs, representing the contribution of each PC to that curve's shape. The three accents, which have distinct pragmatic meanings, were utterance-final in declaratives and elicited from thirteen Greek speakers. PC1 and PC2 captured 87.7\% of the data variance. Statistical modelling of the coefficients revealed presence of multiple cues, including overall shape, curve height, and position of curve peak. Though PCs showed cross-category overlap, together they distinguished the three accents, providing evidence that tonal events are realized by combining multiple cues, and in a variable manner.},

  abstract = {Over the past decades a considerable number of works have observed differences in the phonetic realization of nouns and verbs. The guiding question in most relevant research is whether such differences are caused by grammatical category per se, or are triggered by more general processes of phonetic implementation that impact nouns and verbs differently. Most studies argue for the latter and focus on one particular process or variable, which is advocated to be responsible for the acoustic differences observed. Among the processes mentioned are pre-boundary lengthening, accentuation, and frequency-induced reduction. Due to the focus on monofactorial explanations, an overview and contextualization of the different processes interacting with the noun-verb distinction is yet missing. The present paper aims to fill this gap. This goal is pursed by providing an in-depth discussion of how grammatical category interacts with a number of different processes that affect acoustic realization. To that end results from the literature on the topic are synthesized with new acoustic analyses of noun-verb homophones from spontaneous speech. The analysis shows that differences in acoustic realization between nouns and verbs are caused by the complex interplay of a number of different processes, defying simple, monofactorial explanations.},

It is argued that there is a family of Neodavidsonian proposals that all have in common that they argue for Neodavidsonian logical forms. However, they differ substantially in how they derive these logical forms, notably in what assumptions they make concerning the syntactic structure that serves as an input to the semantic interpretation. The chapter provides an overview of some of the different approaches, closing by defending a view that can be viewed as a natural consequence of the original insight due to Davidson: not only event predicates, but also argument predicates are linked together by way of conjunction.},

We show that there is little evidence to support general ideas about the absence of NP structures, and we argue that it makes more sense to typologize languages on the basis of where and how they allow ``classic'' NP construal, and how this fits into the broader range of construals in the nominal domain.},

The sonority function employed was derived from the posterior probabilities of a broad phonetic class recognizer, trained with data coming from an open-source corpus of English stories. We tested our approach on English, Spanish and Catalan and compared the results obtained to those given by an energy-based system. The proposed method outperformed the energy-based system on all three languages, showing a good generalizability to the two unseen languages. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this work for under-resourced languages.},

These settings are mainly attested in areas of the globe that have been spared from Western settlement colonies. Their study is of great interest for advancing our understanding not just of language contact, but of the social conditions that have shaped language use and language structure for most of human history. Calling for an integrated approach combining sociolinguistic, psycholinguistic, descriptivetypological and ethnographic approaches, I present a number of case studies from West Africa, Amazonia, Northern Australia and Melanesia, and typologize them according to the language ideologies governing them and their known patterns of language use.},

  abstract = {Background: Languages differ greatly both in their syntactic and morphological systems and in the social environments in which they exist. We challenge the view that language grammars are unrelated to social environments in which they are learned and used. Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a statistical analysis of .2,000 languages using a combination of demographic sources and the World Atlas of Language Structures\textemdash{} a database of structural language properties. We found strong relationships between linguistic factors related to morphological complexity, and demographic/socio-historical factors such as the number of language users, geographic spread, and degree of language contact. The analyses suggest that languages spoken by large groups have simpler inflectional morphology than languages spoken by smaller groups as measured on a variety of factors such as case systems and complexity of conjugations. Additionally, languages spoken by large groups are much more likely to use lexical strategies in place of inflectional morphology to encode evidentiality, negation, aspect, and possession. Our findings indicate that just as biological organisms are shaped by ecological niches, language structures appear to adapt to the environment (niche) in which they are being learned and used. As adults learn a language, features that are difficult for them to acquire, are less likely to be passed on to subsequent learners. Languages used for communication in large groups that include adult learners appear to have been subjected to such selection. Conversely, the morphological complexity common to languages used in small groups increases redundancy which may facilitate language learning by infants. Conclusions/Significance: We hypothesize that language structures are subjected to different evolutionary pressures in different social environments. Just as biological organisms are shaped by ecological niches, language structures appear to adapt to the environment (niche) in which they are being learned and used. The proposed Linguistic Niche Hypothesis has implications for answering the broad question of why languages differ in the way they do and makes empirical predictions regarding language acquisition capacities of children versus adults.},

Here, the lecturer's presentation, combined with lecture slides, is recorded and broadcasted in video form. The present study investigates how students organize learning when they have the choice of different representations of content: face-to-face lectures, lecture recordings as video podcasts, and additional text material. Latent class analysis identified three groups with different patterns of integration of these representations of content: (1) students who focused on podcasts; (2) students who made little use of the different representations of content; (3) students who occasionally made use of the different learning opportunities. Students in group 1 with a focus on podcasts achieved best. They devoted more time to learning and made diligent use of a variety of learning strategies such as note-taking, generating summaries, or rehearsing with the podcasts. The results suggest providing different representations of content to take into account differences in learners' preferences and abilities. They speak in favor of podcasts, especially in lectures with a large audience. However, the results also show a group of learners who make minimal use of the various representations of content. Instructional measures should be taken to engage and support these students.},

Two sets of languages, however, show vowel deletion only in certain phonological contexts (and those contexts are different), and retain final vowels in other contexts: a group of four languages in the north, and the Ninde language in the southwest. This paper describes vowel deletion in these languages, and shows that the process of wholesale final vowel deletion, far from being an early rule in Malakula, must have occurred well after Proto-Malakula broke up into various descendant groups or languages, and that it probably occurred on at least seven different independent occasions.},

This very personal account also points out the need for the development of a better and more extensive literature on linguistic fieldwork, and makes suggestions about issues that should be covered in such a literature. The goal of this study is to make a very simple point: that we, as linguists, need to rethink our training of graduate students for fieldwork. While we generally do a very thorough job of teaching them how to elicit and analyse data, we often forget to tell them that there is a personal and practical side to fieldwork that can very well derail their research if they are not prepared for it.

Here, we show how a phylogenetic approach opens the possibility of gaining historical insights from entirely new kinds of linguistic data \textendash{} in this instance, statistical phonotactics. We extract phonotactic data from 112 Pama-Nyungan vocabularies and apply tests for phylogenetic signal, quantifying the degree to which the data reflect phylogenetic history. We test three datasets: (1) binary variables recording the presence or absence of biphones (two-segment sequences) in a lexicon (2) frequencies of transitions between segments, and (3) frequencies of transitions between natural sound classes. Australian languages have been characterized as having a high degree of phonotactic homogeneity. Nevertheless, we detect phylogenetic signal in all datasets. Phylogenetic signal is greater in finer-grained frequency data than in binary data, and greatest in natural-class-based data. These results demonstrate the viability of employing a new source of readily extractable data in historical and comparative linguistics.},

Consequently, a secure understanding of a variable's distribution can hold a key to understanding the forces that have causally shaped it. A storied distribution in linguistics has been Zipf's law, a kind of power law. In the wake of a major debate in the sciences around power-law hypotheses and the unreliability of earlier methods of evaluating them, here we re-evaluate the distributions claimed to characterize phoneme frequencies. We infer the fit of power laws and three alternative distributions to 166 Australian languages, using a maximum likelihood framework. We find evidence supporting earlier results, but also nuancing them and increasing our understanding of them. Most notably, phonemic inventories appear to have a Zipfian-like frequency structure among their most-frequent members (though perhaps also a lognormal structure) but a geometric (or exponential) structure among the least-frequent. We compare these new insights the kinds of causal processes that affect the evolution of phonemic inventories over time, and identify a potential account for why, despite there being an important role for phonetic substance in phonemic change, we could still expect inventories with highly diverse phonetic content to share similar distributions of phoneme frequencies. We conclude with priorities for future work in this promising program of research.},

Yet the path that led to their discovery in comparative biology is so similar to the methodological history of balanced sampling, that it is only an accident of history that they were not discovered by a linguistic typologist. Here we clarify the essential logic behind phylogenetic comparative methods and their fundamental relatedness to a deep intellectual tradition focussed on sampling. Then we introduce concepts, methods and tools which will enable typologists to use these methods in everyday typological research. The key commonality of phylogenetic comparative methods and balanced sampling is that they attempt to deal with statistical non-independence due to genealogy. Whereas sampling can never achieve independence and requires most comparative data to be discarded, phylogenetic comparative methods achieve independence while retaining and using all comparative data. We discuss the essential notions of phylogenetic signal; uncertainty about trees; typological averages and proportions that are sensitive to genealogy; comparison across language families; and the effects of areality. Extensive supplementary materials illustrate computational tools for practical analysis and we illustrate the methods discussed with a typological case study of the laminal contrast in Pama-Nyungan.},

  abstract = {The species-specific organizational property of speech is a continual mouth open-close alternation, the two phases of which are subject to continual articulatory modulation. The cycle constitutes the syllable, and the open and closed phases are segments \textendash{} vowels and consonants, respectively. The fact that segmental serial ordering errors in normal adults obey syllable structure constraints suggests that syllabic ``frames'' and segmental ``content'' elements are separately controlled in the speech production process. The frames may derive from cycles of mandibular oscillation present in humans from babbling onset, which are responsible for the open-close alternation. These communication-related frames perhaps first evolved when the ingestion-related cyclicities of mandibular oscillation (associated with mastication [chewing] sucking and licking) took on communicative significance as lipsmacks, tonguesmacks, and teeth chatters \textendash{} displays that are prominent in many nonhuman primates. The new role of Broca's area and its surround in human vocal communication may have derived from its evolutionary history as the main cortical center for the control of ingestive processes. The frame and content components of speech may have subsequently evolved separate realizations within two general purpose primate motor control systems: (1) a motivation-related medial ``intrinsic'' system, including anterior cingulate cortex and the supplementary motor area, for self-generated behavior, formerly responsible for ancestral vocalization control and now also responsible for frames, and (2) a lateral ``extrinsic'' system, including Broca's area and surround, and Wernicke's area, specialized for response to external input (and therefore the emergent vocal learning capacity) and more responsible for content.},

Assessing the reliability of the coding helps establish the credibility of qualitative findings. We discuss our experience calculating ICR in the context of a behavioural HIV prevention trial for young women in South Africa which involves multiple rounds of longitudinal qualitative data collection. We document the steps that we took to improve ICR in this study, the challenges to improving ICR, and the value of the process to qualitative data analysis.

  abstract = {The variety described here is representative of colloquial Assamese spoken in the eastern districts of Assam. Assam is a North-Eastern state of India, therefore Assamese and creoles of Assamese like Nagamese are spoken in the different North-Eastern states of Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and also the neighbouring country of Bhutan. Approximately 15 million people speak Assamese in India (see               Ethnologue               , Gordon 2005, which lists 15,374,000 speakers including those in Bhutan and Bangladesh). In the pre-British era (until 1826), the kingdom of Assam was ruled by Ahom kings and the then capital was based in the Eastern district of Sibsagar and later in Jorhat. American missionaries established the first printing press in Sibsagar and in the year 1846 published a monthly periodical               Arunodoi               using the variety spoken in and around Sibsagar as the point of departure. This is the immediate reason which led to the acceptance of the formal variety spoken in eastern Assam (which roughly comprises of all the districts of Upper Assam). Having said that, the language spoken in these regions of Assam also show a certain degree of variation from the written form of the `standard' language. As against the relative homogeneity of the variety spoken in eastern Assam, variation is considerable in certain other districts which would constitute the western part of Assam, comprising of the district of Kamrup up to Goalpara and Dhubri (see also Kakati 1962 and Grierson 1968). In contemporary Assam, for the purposes of mass media and communication, a certain neutral blend of eastern Assamese, without too many distinctive eastern features, like /{$\Elztrnr$}/ deletion, which is a robust phenomenon in the eastern varieties, is still considered to be the norm. The lexis of Assamese is mainly Indo-Aryan, but it also has a sizeable amount of lexical items related to Bodo among other Tibeto-Burman languages (Kakati 1962), and there are a substantial number of items borrowed from Hindi, English and Bengali in recent times.},

  abstract = {A major open question in natural language research is the role of communicative efficiency in the origin and on-line processing of language structures. Here, we use word pairs like chimp/chimpanzee, which differ in length but have nearly identical meanings, to investigate the communicative properties of lexical systems and the communicative pressures on language users. If language is designed to be information-theoretically optimal, then shorter words should convey less information than their longer counterparts, when controlling for meaning. Consistent with this prediction, a corpus analysis revealed that the short form of our meaning-matched pairs occurs in more predictive contexts than the longer form. Second, a behavioral study showed that language users choose the short form more often in predictive contexts, suggesting that tendencies to be information-theoretically efficient manifest in explicit behavioral choices. Our findings, which demonstrate the prominent role of communicative efficiency in the structure of the lexicon, complement and extend the results of Piantadosi, Tily, and Gibson (2011), who showed that word length is better correlated with Shannon information content than with frequency. Crucially, we show that this effect arises at least in part from active speaker choice.},

The chapter reviews current assumptions concerning the ontological properties of events and states and evaluates different approaches to a narrow or broad understanding of Davidsonian eventualities. A closer look into a variety of stative expressions reveals substantial differences with respect to a series of linguistic diagnostics that point towards deeper ontological differences. Acknowledging these differences leads to a differentiation of the cover notion of states into three separate ontological categories: D-states, K-states, and tropes. Once these three stative categories are disentangled and receive their proper place in the ontological universe, this not only allows the observed linguistic behavior to be accounted for, but it also sharpens our understanding of Davidsonian eventualities.},

Traditional linguistic fieldwork has relied heavily on elicitation and observation, with a view to producing a grammar, dictionary, and texts. This is often accompanied by mining texts, i.e., narratives by speakers, for naturalistic examples. This sort of data can fruitfully elucidate lexical and constructional resources within a language, their formal properties, the kinds of expressions that occur, and so on. The article sets out a guide to the various stages of constructing a non-linguistic stimulus set in order to investigate semantic categories within a language. This should furnish a novice to this field with some of the key concepts and issues so that they can construct their own study. The focus in this article is how to use non-linguistic stimuli for a more thorough investigation of local semantic categories. Semantics is at the heart of linguistic description. The field linguist attempts to identify the sound units that convey distinctions in meaning \textemdash{} the lexical and grammatical classes that can be grouped together and distinguished for function, and so on.

But the extent to which semantic categories are universal or language-specific remains highly controversial. Focusing on the domain of events involving material destruction (``cutting and breaking'' events, for short), this study investigates how speakers of different languages implicitly categorize such events through the verbs they use to talk about them. Speakers of 28 typologically, genetically and geographically diverse languages were asked to describe the events shown in a set of videoclips, and the distribution of their verbs across the events was analyzed with multivariate statistics. The results show that there is considerable agreement across languages in the dimensions along which cutting and breaking events are distinguished, although there is variation in the number of categories and the placement of their boundaries. This suggests that there are strong constraints in human event categorization, and that variation is played out within a restricted semantic space.},

  abstract = {The article examines Hebrew morphological and syntactic constructions as grammatical markers for conceptual and linguistic integration operations (Fauconnier and Turner 1996, 1998). The comparison of integration operations in Hebrew and English reveals a very general scheme: languages possess basic clause-structure constructions (such as the intransitive, transitive, or caused-motion syntactic construction), each associated with a generic conceptual event schema. These constructions serve as integrating frames for expressing novel conceived events. Speakers subjectively project partial information from an initial representation of the novel conceived event onto an integrating syntactic construction, thereby linguistically highlighting some aspects of the event over others. Since a large number of possible projections are possible, grammatical formalisms have evolved in dierent languages to systematically mark such linguistic integration operations. This article suggests that the Hebrew verbal morphological system of binyanim provides such formalism to explicitly mark conceptual integration operations. Dierent grammatical meanings associated with Hebrew binyanim, such as causative, passive, middle, or re\textasciimacron exive, are produced directly by the projection schemes.},

  abstract = {Children's perception of prosodic phrasing provides a head start into the discovery of speech structure. Based on the close prosody\textendash syntax correspondence, children can infer the underlying syntactic structure from the acoustic modulations of prosodic boundaries, typically consisting of co-occurring pitch changes, preboundary lengthening, and pausing. Previous electrophysiological studies revealed that listeners are to some degree flexible in the detection of major prosodic boundaries that are not marked with all three of the suprasegmental cues. Adults and 6-year-olds still showed the brain response for prosodic boundary perception, the Closure Positive Shift (CPS), when pauses marking boundaries were deleted. In contrast, younger children at 3 years did not show this ability yet, but required pausing to complement the other boundary cues. Following the hypothesis that German weights duration cues more heavily than pitch cues, we here examined 3-yearolds' brain responses to prosodic phrasing, testing the role of boundary-related pitch changes. Results revealed that children at this age even showed the CPS in response to pitch-neutralized boundaries with only pausing and preboundary lengthening being present. These results indicate differential roles of acoustic cues in boundary perception, with a preferential reliance on duration cues over pitch changes in 3-year-olds. This preference likely results from the characteristics of the German intonation system and furthers the discussion of cross-linguistic differences in the weighting of prosodic boundary cues.},

However, I argue that in Stratal Phonology (Berm\'udezOtero 2016), where prosodic constituents are formed and reformed on distinct morphological strata, we may formulate a motivated account in which prosodic compounding fills a typological gap.

I hypothesize that word constructions tend to be more ``internally predictable'' than phrase constructions, where internal predictability is the degree to which the entropy of one constructional element is reduced by mutual information with another element. I illustrate the method with case studies of complex verbs in German and Murrinhpatha, comparing verbs with selectionally restricted elements against those built from free elements. I propose that this method identifies an important mathematical property of many word-like structures, though I do not expect that it will solve all the problems of wordhood.},

Aboriginal people from the homelands often visit Darwin, and some become permanent residents, which provides the context for new types of multilingual encounters. Kriol and English are also used as a `fall-back' languages to mitigate gaps in understanding, which allows multilingual interaction to occur between people who have only partial knowledge of eachothers' languages. I characterise these practices as `linguistic exchange', used by speakers to establish their links to kin and country, while also showing respect for their interlocutor's social connections. Linguistic exchange also supports the distinctive Aboriginal mode of demand-driven resource sharing. Aboriginal language use in Darwin suggests that urban mobility is not necessarily detrimental to the future vitality of the region's rich linguistic heritage.},

Prosodic hierarchy theory proposes that syntactic constituents are systematically mapped to prosodic constituents, but most versions of the theory do not account for clause chain syntax. This article presents original data from Matukar Panau, a clause-chaining Oceanic (Austronesian) language of Papua New Guinea. The clause chain is a syntactic constituent in which final-clause TAM scopes over preceding clauses. There are also other types of multi-clausal structures, encompassing subordinate adverbial clauses, and verbless copula clauses, and we analyse all these as instances of the ``syntactic sentence.'' The syntactic sentence maps to a distinct prosodic domain, marked by the scaling of L\% boundary tones, and we equate this domain with the ``utterance phrase'' posited in some versions of prosodic hierarchy theory. The prosodic characteristics of the Matukar Panau utterance phrase are similar to those found in non-chaining languages, but while other languages use this prosody to mark pragmatically related groups of clauses, in Matukar Panau it most commonly maps to a syntactic sentence.},

One aim of the present work is to make the corpus of data in Manzini and Savoia (2005) accessible in English. The corpus displays a certain amount of microparametric variation, which is also known, in a less complete form, from independently collected data. On the basis of the evidence presented, we will discuss the two major syntactic analyses proposed for this type of sentences. Under the mono-clausal analysis, verbs like `stay, `go' etc. are functional heads embedding a lexical predicate (Cardinaletti and Giusti 2001, 2003). The bi-clausal analysis on the contrary treats embedding under `stay', `go' etc. as anormal clausal embedding (Manzini and Savoia 2005). In this article we reiterate that the bi-clausal analysis is not only feasible, but also advantageous, from a morphosyntactic point of view. We conclude by sketching how this analysis can be rendered compatible with the mono-eventive interpretation that at least some of the relevant structures are reported to have.},

Like other machine learning technologies, speech and language technologies (re)produce structural oppression when they perform worse for marginalised language communities. Using knowledge and theories from sociolinguistics, I explore why commercial automatic speech recognition systems and other language technologies perform significantly worse for already marginalised populations, such as second-language speakers and speakers of stigmatised varieties of English in the British Isles. Situating language technologies within the broader scholarship around algorithmic bias, consider the allocative and representational harms they can cause even (and perhaps especially) in systems which do not exhibit predictive bias, narrowly defined as differential performance between groups. This raises the question whether addressing or ``fixing'' this ``bias'' is actually always equivalent to mitigating the harms algorithmic systems can cause, in particular to marginalised communities.},

Loss of initial consonants is a well-documented historical process in many Australian languages (Blevins, Juliette. 2001. Where have all the onsets gone? Initial consonant loss in Australian Aboriginal languages. In Jane Simpson, David Nash, Mary Laughren, Peter Austin \& Barry Alpher (eds.), Forty years on: Ken Hale and Australian languages, 481\textendash 492. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics), but there has been no systematic analysis of initial consonant loss as a synchronic variable (Fletcher, Janet \& Andrew Butcher 2014. Sound patterns of Australian languages. In Harold Koch \& Rachel Nordlinger (eds.), The languages and linguistics of Australia, 91\textendash 138. Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton). In the case of Kunwok, word-initial velar nasal deletion (e.g. nganabbarru {$\sim$} anabbarru `buffalo') has been described as having regional distribution and is a prominent feature of speakers from the western and southern peripheries of the dialect chain, but variable in speakers from the central region (Evans, Nicholas. 2003. Bininj Kunwok: A pan-dialectal grammar of Mayali, Kunwinjku and Kune. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics). This study tests the distribution of the word-initial engma for both linguistic conditioning and sociolinguistic factors, and arrives at three conclusions. First, that preceding environment is a contributing factor. Second, that morphological class is a categorical conditioning factor. And third, that the phenomenon is spreading and there is evidence of language change in progress. This paper also takes into consideration community perspectives, noting that the sound change in progress is accompanied by a change in perceptions.},

We address conceptual issues involved in studying morphosyntax along parametric lines and show how the data we have can be used for the quantitative study of language comparison. Although the work reported is a case study in need of expansion, we will show that it nevertheless produces relevant results.},

Pluralization is one of the criteria proposed by Grimshaw (1990) to distinguish between the two: unlike result nominals, event nominals never admit pluralization. However, several recent works have argued that telic/bounded event nominals generally pluralize, unless some structural condition blocks it (Iord\u{a}chioaia \& Soare 2008, Alexiadou et al. 2008).},

In Ambonese Malay, the alignment of sentence-final pitch peaks fails to support the existence of either word stress or phrase-final pitch accents. Also, the shape of its pitch peaks fails to vary systematically with the information status of the phrase-final word. The two intonation melodies of the language include phrase-final boundary-tone complexes which do not associate with any syllables. The declarative rise-fall would appear to be timed so as to occur within the last word of the sentence. Minimal stress pairs presented in earlier descriptions show a contrast between /a/ and a segmentally distinct weak /\u{a}/, a contrast that also appears in positions that have not been claimed to have stress. A preliminary phonological analysis concludes the account.},

  title = {Pseudo {{Noun Incorporation}} in {{Niuean}}},
  author = {Massam, Diane},
  pages = {46},
  abstract = {This paper examines a phenomenon of Niuean (Oceanic) often called Noun Incorporation (NI). It is shown that, since the nominal element in these constructions is a phrase (NP) rather than a head (N0), this phenomenon does not in fact constitute NI in the normal sense of the term. Instead, it is termed PSEUDO NOUN INCORPORATION, or PNI. An analysis is presented in which an object NP (rather than DP) is generated adjacent to a verb. Since NP cannot check absolutive case, it fails to move out of VP, hence it undergoes predicate fronting along with the verb to derive the 'incorporated' order V-O-PARTICLESS-X: the normal order is V-PARTICLES-S-O-X. The properties of three subtypes of PNI are examined in some detail: general PNI, existential PNI, and instrumental PNI, and the analysis is developed to account for their properties. General PNI involves the generation of an NP object, in which the referential position remains open, resulting in a habitual reading for the sentence. Instrumental PNI is similar, except it does not have the same aspectual consequences. In existential PNI, on the other hand, an existential verb (0ai 'have/be', muhu 'have plenty/be plentiful') binds the position in NP, thus allowing the NP to be referential and to be modified by a relative clause. Existential PNI thus results from a hybrid V/DET category (such as fai) which simultaneously binds the open position in NP and acts as the head predicate of the sentence. We see that the propertie.s of Niuean PNI do not fit into the various typologies of NI available in the literature, hence a novel analysis is required, such as the one proposed in this paper.},

The results show that despite claims to the contrary, conversational Japanese cannot be regarded as ``highly fragmented'', but basically conforms to the ``one IU, one clause'' strategy. It is argued that the One New NP per IU Constraint is an information-flow factor motivating toward the ``marked'' production of multi-IU clauses, that is, the breakup of a clause into phrasal IUs.},

En esta obra Gilij abord\'o, con una visi\'on enciclop\'edica y una metodolog\'ia en muchos aspectos moderna, las facetas m\'as diversas y m\'as in\'editas del territorio venezolano de aquella \'epoca: su geograf\'ia, dando informaciones precisas referentes a la red fluvial orinoquense, a su toponimia, a sus or\'igenes y su interconexi\'on con la cuenca amaz\'onica, sus variaciones clim\'aticas relacionadas con la alternancia de lluvia y sequ\'ia, sus recursos naturales, en particular de flora y fauna. Proporciona numerosos datos relativos al valor alimenticio u otros usos de los mam\'iferos, como tambi\'en de aves, peces, reptiles e insectos. Para la flora describe los m\'ultiples usos tanto de las plantas silvestres como de las cultivadas. Pero los dominios que quiz\'as cautivaron m\'as su atenci\'on y sobre los cuales dej\'o documentos de suma importancia pertenecen al conocimiento antropol\'ogico de los pueblos originarios que encontr\'o y con los cuales vivi\'o en la cuenca del Orinoco. De estos pueblos Gilij estudi\'o y describi\'o no solo sus lenguas, sus modos de vida y sus ritos, sino tambi\'en sus conocimientos de la naturaleza, sus sistemas agr\'icolas, su utilizaci\'on razonable de los espacios geogr\'aficos. Aun m\'as, supo apreciar la belleza tanto de sus lenguas como de sus paisajes. En este art\'iculo destacamos la importancia de Gilij en los diversos campos de las ciencias naturales y como precursor de la ling\"u\'istica amerindia y pionero en diversos campos de la american\'istica.},

Although LMMs have many advantages over ANOVA, like ANOVAs, setting them up for data analysis also requires some care. One simple option, when numerically possible, is to fit the full variancecovariance structure of random effects (the maximal model; Barr, Levy, Scheepers \& Tily, 2013), presumably to keep Type I error down to the nominal a in the presence of random effects. Although it is true that fitting a model with only random intercepts may lead to higher Type I error, fitting a maximal model also has a cost: it can lead to a significant loss of power. We demonstrate this with simulations and suggest that for typical psychological and psycholinguistic data, higher power is achieved without inflating Type I error rate if a model selection criterion is used to select a random effect structure that is supported by the data.},

  abstract = {When speaking a foreign language, non-native speakers can typically be readily identified by their accents. But which aspects of the speech signal determine such accents? Speech pauses occur in all languages but may nonetheless vary in different languages with regard to their duration, number or positions in the speech stream, and therefore are one potential contributor to foreign speech production. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate whether non-native speakers pause `with a foreign accent'. We recorded native English speakers and non-native speakers of German or Serbo-Croatian with excellent English reading out an English text at three different speech rates, and analyzed their vocal output in terms of number, duration and location of pauses. Overall, all non-native speakers were identified by native raters as having non-native accents, but native and non-native speakers made pauses that were similarly long, and had similar ratios of pause time compared to total speaking time. Furthermore, all speakers changed their pausing behavior similarly at different speech rates. The only clear difference between native and non-native speakers was that the latter made more pauses than the native speakers. Thus, overall, pause patterns contributed little to the acoustic characteristics of speakers' non-native accents, when reading aloud. Non-native pause patterns might be acquired more easily than other aspects of pronunciation because pauses are perceptually salient and producing pauses is easy. Alternatively, general cognitive processing mechanisms such as attention, planning or memory may constrain pausing behavior, allowing speakers to transfer their native pause patterns to a second language without significant deviation. We conclude that pauses make a relatively minor contribution to the acoustic characteristics of non-native accents.},

  abstract = {A prerequisite for spoken language learning is segmenting continuous speech into words. Amongst many possible cues to identify word boundaries, listeners can use both transitional probabilities between syllables and various prosodic cues. However, the relative importance of these cues remains unclear, and previous experiments have not directly compared the effects of contrasting multiple prosodic cues. We used artificial language learning experiments, where native German speaking participants extracted meaningless trisyllabic ``words'' from a continuous speech stream, to evaluate these factors. We compared a baseline condition (statistical cues only) to five test conditions, in which word-final syllables were either (a) followed by a pause, (b) lengthened, (c) shortened, (d) changed to a lower pitch, or (e) changed to a higher pitch. To evaluate robustness and generality we used three tasks varying in difficulty. Overall, pauses and final lengthening were perceived as converging with the statistical cues and facilitated speech segmentation, with pauses helping most. Final-syllable shortening hindered baseline speech segmentation, indicating that when cues conflict, prosodic cues can override statistical cues. Surprisingly, pitch cues had little effect, suggesting that duration may be more relevant for speech segmentation than pitch in our study context. We discuss our findings with regard to the contribution to speech segmentation of language-universal boundary cues vs. language-specific stress patterns.},

  abstract = {Directive strategies, i.e. strategies through which the speaker orders someone to do something, are very frequent in everyday speech, and are particularly subject to processes of diachronic renewal. Based on a 200-language sample, this paper provides an extensive survey of the most frequent diachronic processes of emergence of positive directive strategies (imperatives, hortatives, jussives, etc.). Three basic processes are discussed: (i) the grammaticalization of lexical material into markers of orders and commands; (ii) the cooptation of non-directive forms (used in indirect speech acts) as directive strategies; and (iii) the creation of new directive strategies through constructionalization of various types of insubordinated clauses. The stages and outcomes of these processes are reconstructed on the basis of the available diachronic and synchronic evidence. In some of these processes, the identity of the performer of the order (addressee, speaker + addressee, third party) turns out to play a crucial role in favouring the development of a non-directive strategy into a directive one. Other diachronic processes, on the contrary, are shown to be connected to the widespread tendency to express orders in an indirect way, i.e. by putting the face-threatening component of directive speech acts off-stage.},

Discourse structure is also known to affect the accessibility/salience of antecedents of anaphoric expressions. Assuming these generalizations are correct, one can ask whether listeners use the information encoded in pauses and pitch range to resolve anaphoric references in ambiguous contexts. To examine this, we conducted a series of perception experiments with ambiguous discourses, where the pitch range of the sentences and the pause duration between sentences was manipulated. The results of our experiments corroborate our main research hypothesis that global prosodic parameters influence the resolution of anaphoric pronouns. The direction of the observed effect is clearly in accordance with the predictions of the existing theories of discourse anaphora and the current state of research on discourse prosody.},

It can be regarded as a 'missing link' in tonogenesis: following the loss of voicing contrasts on syllable-initial consonants, Tamang has four tonal categories instead of its earlier two-tone system; the present state of the prosodic system is typologically transitional, in that these four tonal categories are realised by several cues which include fundamental frequency (F0), phonation type, and allophonic variation in the realisation of consonants. Acoustic and electroglottographic recordings of 131 words in two carrier sentences by five speakers were conducted (total number of target syllables analysed: 1651). They allow for a description in terms of F0, glottal open quotient, duration, and realisation of consonants. The results confirm the diversity of cues to the four tonal categories, and show evidence of laxness on tones 3 and 4, i.e. on the two tones which originate diachronically in voiced initials. The discussion hinges on the phonological definition of tone.},

MFA uses Kaldi instead of HTK, allowing MFA to be distributed as a stand-alone package, and to exploit parallel processing for computationally-intensive training and scaling to larger datasets. We evaluate MFA's performance on aligning word and phone boundaries in English conversational and laboratory speech, relative to human-annotated boundaries, focusing on the effects of aligner architecture and training on the data to be aligned. MFA performs well relative to two existing open-source aligners with simpler architecture (Prosodylab-Aligner and FAVE), and both its improved architecture and training on data to be aligned generally result in more accurate boundaries.},

However, research on morphological awareness is relatively rare. In this study, over 660 preschool-aged children from three language groups (Cantonese, Mandarin, and Korean speakers) in which compounding morphology is highly prevalent were tested on their abilities to manipulate familiar morphemes to create novel compound words as well as on a variety of early language and reasoning measures twice over the span of 9 months to 1 year. With Time 1 vocabulary knowledge, phonological processing, and reasoning skills controlled, morphological awareness predicted unique variance in Time 2 vocabulary knowledge across languages. Across languages, vocabulary knowledge also predicted unique variance in subsequent morphological awareness, with Time 1 morphological awareness controlled. Findings underscore the bidirectional bootstrapping of morphological awareness and vocabulary acquisition for languages in which lexical compounding is prominent, and suggest that morphological awareness may be practically important in predicting and fostering children's early vocabulary learning.},

Fluency undoubtedly involves a degree of automaticity and the ability quickly to retrieve ready-made chunks of language. However, fluency also involves the ability to create flow and smoothness across turn-boundaries and can be seen as an interactive phenomenon in discourse. The article offers corpus evidence for the notion of confluence, that is the joint production of flow by more than one speaker, focusing in particular on turn-openings and closings. It considers the implications of an interactive view of fluency for pedagogy, assessment and in the broader social context.},

This perspective suffuses Jackendoff's (2007) response to our position paper (Bybee and McClelland 2005). We argue that gradience is an inherent feature of language representation, processing, and learning, and that natural language exhibits all degrees of gradience. Contrary to Jackendoff's assertions, we do not reject the possibility of innate constraints on language, feeling only that the jury is out on the nature and specificity of such constraints. We address a number of questions Jackendoff raises about the process of grammaticalization, drawing on extant literature of which he appears to be unaware. We also address Jackendoff's views on the prospect that connectionist models can address core aspects of language processing and representation. Here again extant literature of which Jackendoff seems unaware addresses all four of his general objections to connectionist approaches.},

  abstract = {An elicitation task was conducted with speakers of Japonic varieties to investigate whether stimuli of varying sensory modalities (e.g. audio, visual, tactile etc.) were more or less likely to elicit ideophones or iconic words. Stimuli representing sounds, movements, shapes and textures were most likely to elicit ideophones, and this is posited to reflect the relative ease or naturalness with which these domains can be mapped iconically to speech. The results mirror macro-level patterns of linguistic diversity, as these are also domains in which ideophones are most widely attested cross-linguistically. The findings call for the revision of a previously constructed implicational hierarchy for the semantic development of ideophone systems, adding to it the categories of FORM and TEXTURE as domains in which ideophones are most likely to develop, after SOUND and MOVEMENT. Independent evidence for the revised hierarchy comes from a semantic analysis of the elicited ideophones, where it was found that domains early in the hierarchy were more likely to be sources for semantic extension, while later domains were more likely to be targets. These findings are expected to be replicable for other languages, and offer exciting new directions for research into the semantic typology of ideophones.},

It then considers the situation of Aboriginal Australians in the period up until 1967 in the light of the concept. The article concludes with a discussion of the way in which we may understand the anti-shibboleth theoretically, drawing on insights from poststructuralism.},

Critics and the galleries of the world which hold his paintings, especially those he painted in his typical style of vertically arranged blocks of colour after the critical year 1949, often present his work using terms such as `ethereal', `spiritual', `luminous', `mystical', `sublime'. But this discourse about Rothko appears at odds with Rothko's own way of talking about his paintings, which he looked at as `dramas' whose subject was `the basic human emotions \textendash{} tragedy, ecstasy, doom and so on'. The article proposes that the mature paintings share a principle of organization, a syntax, which allows the expression of specific dramas of feeling in each painting. First, I suggest that the separate blocks of colour are to be read vertically, from top to bottom. Second, each block of colour is made up of multiple fine layers of paint of different colours. I argue that Rothko exploits the layering to enact a drama of feeling in each panel. I test out this argument by offering readings of three characteristic works of Rothko, and relate the discussion to Jaffe's (Sociolinguistics: Theoretical debates, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge) discussion of indexical fields.},

This paper introduces a metric of complexity, determined by degree of overt signalling of various phonetic, morphological, syntactic, and semantic distinctions beyond communicative necessity. By this metric, a subset of creole languages display less overall grammatical complexity than older languages, by virtue of the fact that they were born as pidgins, and thus stripped of almost all features unnecessary to communication, and since then have not existed as natural languages for a long enough time for diachronic drift to create the weight of ``ornament'' that encrusts older languages. It is demonstrated that this complexity differential remains robust even when creoles are compared with older languages lacking inflection, contra claims by theoretical syntacticians that the typology of creoles is largely a manifestation of parameter settings resulting from low inflection. The overall aim is to bolster a general paradigm arguing that creole languages are delineable synchronically as well as sociohistorically.},

Despite these clear sources, Gurindji Kriol contains grammatical systems which are not found in Gurindji or Kriol, for example asymmetrical serial verb constructions. The origin of these constructions is unclear given that Kriol only contains a very limited set of serial verb constructions and they are not found in Gurindji. The development of asymmetrical serial verb constructions is examined and it is suggested that they are a product of the more restricted Kriol serial verb construction developing and expanding under the influence of the Gurindji complex verb. The formation of this construction was a part of the more general genesis of the mixed language which was derived from code-switching.},

  abstract = {Rigorous definitions are proposed for three important syntactic-morphological concepts: agreement, government and congruence. They are defined as particular cases of morphological dependency between wordforms of an utterance (distinguished from semantic and syntactic dependencies between wordforms). Definitions are based on the intermediate concepts of agreement class and related inflectional categories, as well as on the concepts of inflectional category, grammeme, syntactics feature and syntactics feature value. AGREEMENT is defined (roughly speaking) as a morphological dependency where a grammeme of the target, which is not a substitute pronoun, is selected depending either 1) upon a grammeme of a related category of the controller, or 2) upon its agreement class, pronominal person or pronominal number (syntactics features), or else 3) upon some of its semantic properties. GOVERNMENT is defined as a morphological dependency where a grammeme of the target is selected depending either 1) upon a grammeme of an unrelated category of the controller or 2) upon one of its syntactics features, which is not agreement class, pronominal person or pronominal number. CONGRUENCE is defined as a morphological dependency where a grammeme of the target, which is a substitute pronoun replacing an occurrence of the controller, is selected depending upon any property of the controller. Numerous examples of agreement, government and congruence are cited and analyzed, a comparison of agreement and government is presented, and relationships between these concepts and other types of dependencies are examined.},

Thinking about the title early\textemdash and regularly returning to hone it\textemdash can help not only the writing of the paper but also the process of designing experiments or developing theories. This Rule of One is the most difficult rule to optimally implement because it comes face-toface with the key challenge of science, which is to make the claim and/or model as simple as the data and logic can support but no simpler. In the end, your struggle to find this balance may appropriately result in ``one contribution'' that is multifaceted.

  abstract = {In recent years, the phenomenon of cumulative cultural evolution (CCE) has become the focus of major research interest in biology, psychology and anthropology. Some researchers argue that CCE is unique to humans and underlies our extraordinary evolutionary success as a species. Others claim to have found CCE in non-human species. Yet others remain sceptical that CCE is even important for explaining human behavioural diversity and complexity. These debates are hampered by multiple and often ambiguous definitions of CCE. Here, we review how researchers define, use and test CCE. We identify a core set of criteria for CCE which are both necessary and sufficient, and may be found in non-human species. We also identify a set of extended criteria that are observed in human CCE but not, to date, in other species. Different socio-cognitive mechanisms may underlie these different criteria. We reinterpret previous theoretical models and observational and experimental studies of both human and non-human species in light of these more fine-grained criteria. Finally, we discuss key issues surrounding information, fitness and cognition. We recommend that researchers are more explicit about what components of CCE they are testing and claiming to demonstrate.},

These include causative constructions, a variety of applicative constructions and the portative construction which is a valency-increasing construction that is lexically restricted to motion verbs. In the portative construction, the verb's valency is increased by adding theme as a P-argument, but conceptually there is also an element of (co-motional) causation. However, the paper argues that the construction is neither causative nor applicative. Instead, the portative construction, which is frequent in the sample languages, should be considered a distinct type of valency-increasing construction.},

On the one hand, speech contains\textemdash somewhat\textemdash repetitive trains of air pressure bursts that occur at three dominant amplitude modulation frequencies, physically marking the linguistically meaningful progressions of phonemes, syllables and intonational phrase boundaries. To these acoustic events, neural oscillations of isomorphous operating frequencies are thought to synchronise, presumably resulting in an implicit temporal alignment of periods of neural excitability to linguistically meaningful spectral information on the three lowlevel linguistic description levels. On the other hand, speech is a carrier signal that codes for high-level linguistic meaning, such as syntactic structure and semantic information\textemdash which cannot be read from stimulus acoustics, but must be acquired during language acquisition and decoded for language comprehension. Neural oscillations subserve the processing of both syntactic structure and semantic information. Here, I synthesise a mapping from each linguistic processing domain to a unique set of subserving oscillatory mechanisms\textemdash the mapping is plausible given the role ascribed to different oscillatory mechanisms in different subfunctions of cortical information processing and faithful to the underlying electrophysiology. In sum, the present article provides an accessible and extensive review of the functional mechanisms that neural oscillations subserve in speech processing and language comprehension.},

Morphosyntactic and semantic features that might transfer from substrate languages (referent's animacy, (in)alienable possession) and social factors (age, sex, language of education) are also examined. Strong priming effects for grammatical role of the antecedent and form of the antecedent are identified. Also salient are inalienable possession and semantic type of the verb. The effect of inalienable possession shows the highly abstract transfer of substrate features, raising questions about the modularity of grammar. It is argued that a key motivation for such transfer is not just linguistic availability, but the social and cultural significance of different kinds of possession in Melanesia.},

  abstract = {Typically, a study of variation starts from the known and works its way into the unknown. But what happens when you are analyzing variation at the same time as you are grappling with the fundamental structure of the language? Whereas variationist methods often involve doing strategic violence to the data, isolating single variables, documentation tends to encourage a broader perspective. This article shows how documentation of Nkep (Central Eastern Oceanic, Vanuatu) has progressed when guided by a focus on internal and social variation. Three variables are discussed (the near merger of two front vowels, lexical borrowing, and the expression of subject agreement) to highlight the rewards and challenges associated with drawing together two subdisciplines (variation and documentation) that have not traditionally had much to say to each other. Analyzing variation alongside documentation encourages us to write `symphonies of variation', as opposed to `sonatas' of individual variables.},

These are contextualized with personal reflections on variationist sociolinguistics and the profession of \-linguistics that frame each paper. This review article highlights some of the key themes in the collection: As well as social meaning itself, issues with style, clustering of variables, peripheral and core members of communities, and agency are discussed. Eckert's innovative proposal that variables can be differentiated on the basis of their relative ``interiority'' is considered, as is the assertion that linguistics transcends the referential properties of language to include the expressive and moral.},

  abstract = {Sociolinguistic fieldwork is at the core of this article. It is challenging to provide an account of methods associated with sociolinguistic fieldwork, as the field of sociolinguistics is extremely heterogeneous. Researchers who identify as sociolinguists may be asking questions about the relationship between language and power. They may equally be interested in the functions of and structural constraints on switches between different languages or dialects in a polylectal speech community. Sociolinguists have always been heavily influenced by anthropology, not least in their methods, and this means that a lot of sociolinguistic research reports qualitative results, in addition to the quantitative results of the Labovian social dialect survey. This article reviews two of the dominant approaches in sociolinguistic fieldwork: the sociolinguistic interview and participant observation. This dichotomy is an idealization, but it is a useful heuristic around which to structure the article. Since many of the methodological issues that sociolinguists have to deal with in their fieldwork overlap with those of any other linguist, some of the technical and procedural aspects of sociolinguistic fieldwork are explained in the article. This article extensively explores the intersection between sociolinguistic fieldwork and ethnographic traditions in anthropology and sociology, especially the shared interests in documenting everyday and unmonitored speech as a window on speakers' ideologies about and attitudes to language, society, and their interlocutors.},

By focusing on the linguistic and socio-historical changes of the past 200 years, it aims to bring a new dimension to the study of Pacific linguistics, which up until now has been dominated by questions of historical reconstruction and language typology. In contrast to the traditional portrayal of linguistic change as a natural process, the author focuses on the cultural and historical forces which drive language change. Using the metaphor of language ecology to explain and describe the complex interplay between languages, speakers and social practice, the author looks at how language ecologies have functioned in the past to sustain language diversity, and, at what happens when those ecologies are disrupted. Whilst most of the examples used in the book are taken from the Pacific and Australian region, the insights derived from this area are shown to have global applications. The text should be useful for linguists and all those interested in the large scale loss of human language.},

Here we discuss a long-observed and striking characteristic of diachronic sound patterns in Australian languages, namely the scarcity of evidence they present for regular sound change. Since the regularity assumption is fundamental to the comparative method, Australian languages pose an interesting challenge for linguistic theory. We examine the situation from two different angles. We identify potential explanations for the lack of evidence of regular sound change, reasoning from the nature of synchronic Australian phonologies; and we emphasise how this unusual characteristic of Australian languages may demand new methods of evaluating evidence for diachronic relatedness, and new thinking about the nature of intergenerational transmission. We refer the reader also to Bowern (this volume) for additional viewpoints from which the Australian conundrum can be approached.},

  abstract = {Implicit type shifting, or coercion, appears to indicate a modular grammatical architecture, in which the process of semantic composition may add meanings absent from the syntax in order to ensure that certain operators, e.g., the progressive, receive suitable arguments (Jackendo\textcurrency{} 1997; De Swart 1998). I will argue that coercion phenomena actually provide strong support for a sign-based model of grammar, in which rules of morphosyntactic combination can shift the designations of content words with which they combine. On this account, enriched composition is a by-product of the ordinary referring behavior of constructions. Thus, for example, the constraint which requires semantic concord between the syntactic sisters in the string a bottle is also what underlies the coerced interpretation found in a beer. If this concord constraint is stated for a rule of morphosyntactic combination, we capture an important generalization: a single combinatory mechanism, the construction, is responsible for both coerced and compositional meanings. Since both type-selecting constructions (e.g., the French Imparfait) and type-shifting constructions (e.g., English progressive aspect) require semantic concord between syntactic sisters, we account for the fact that constructions of both types perform coercion. Coercion data suggest that aspectual sensitivity is not merely a property of formally di\textcurrency erentiated past tenses, as in French and Latin, but a general property of tense constructions, including the English present and past tenses.},

  abstract = {Creole languages consistently show valency patterns that cannot be traced back to their lexifier languages, but derive from their substrate languages. In this paper, I start out from the observation that a convincing case for substrate influence can be made by adopting a world-wide comparative approach. If there are recurrent matches between substrate and creole structures in a given construction type, in creoles of different world regions and with different substrates, then we can exclude the possibility of an accident, and substrate influence is the only explanation. The construction types that I will look at are ditransitive constructions (Section 3), weather constructions (Section 4), experiencer constructions (Section 5), and motion constructions (Section 6). I will draw on the unique typological data source from the Atlas of Pidgin and Creole Language Structures (Michaelis et al., 2013a; 2013b). My conclusion is that the data provided in APiCS support the claim that during creolization, valency patterns have been systematically calqued into the nascent creoles.},

It has further been shown by laryngoscopy that in three languages which retain the nonreleased syllable-final obstruents /p/, /t/ and /k/ (Standard Thai, and two Chinese dialects), these obstruents are often accompanied by a glottal stop. The present research raises the issue whether there is another typological possibility: can nonreleased final obstruents be accompanied consistently by modal phonation, without glottal stop? Analysis of electroglottographic recordings of 126 syllables in two carrier sentences spoken by 4 speakers shows that, in Hanoi Vietnamese, the final obstruents /p/, /t/ and /k/ are not accompanied by glottalization, and that the open quotient increases in the course of the syllable rhyme. Obstruent-final rhymes (which may carry either of two tones: D1 or D2) are compared with nasal-final rhymes which, under one of the tones (tone B2), are confirmed to be glottalized. Our finding is that tones D1 and D2 (i.e. obstruent-final rhymes) are both produced in modal voice, which shows that the typological paradigm of observed realizations of syllable-final obstruents must be enlarged. The discussion puts forward the hypothesis that the unusual association of segments and voice quality found in Hanoi Vietnamese is a strategy to maintain the opposition between B2-tone and D2-tone rhymes.},

  abstract = {The Western dialect of Naxi has four lexical tones: High, Mid, Low and Rising; the latter is rare in the lexicon. Rising contours on monosyllables are frequent in connected speech, however, as a result of a process of syllable reduction: reduction of a morpheme carrying the High tone results in re-association of its tone to the syllable that precedes it in the sentence, creating a rising contour. An experiment (with one speaker and five listeners) establishes that there is not only one rising contour that originates in tonal reassociation, as reported in earlier descriptions, but two: Low-to-High and Mid-to-High\textemdash as could be expected by analogy with phenomena observed in Niger-Congo languages and elsewhere. A second set of experiments (same speaker; six listeners) investigates the reduction of Mid- and Low-tone syllables: they reduce to [{$\Elzschwa$}{\=]} and [{$\Elzschwa$}{\`]} , respectively, and coalesce with the preceding syllable (in Naxi, syllabic structure is simply consonant+glide+vowel). Unlike High-tone syllable reduction, this process stops short of complete tonal de-linking. These experiments aim to provide a complete picture of syllable reduction patterns in Naxi. It is argued that the notions of floating tones and tonal reassociation can be usefully applied to the Naxi data.},

Structural similarities and differences (symmetry and asymmetry) between negatives and affirmatives can be observed and classified into different types which can then be offered functional explanations. Negative strategies used in imperatives, existentials and nonverbal clauses often differ from standard negation; these differences are exemplified and discussed. The interaction between negative indefinite pronouns and standard negation shows interesting cross-linguistic variation in terms of whether the latter co-occurs with the indefinite and whether the indefinite is inherently negative.

However, the adaptive reasons for the evolution of uniquely sophisticated cumulative culture in our species remain unclear. We propose that the cultural capabilities of humans are the evolutionary result of a stepwise transition from the ape-like lifestyle of earlier hominins to the foraging niche still observed in extant hunter\textendash gatherers. Recent ethnographic, archaeological and genetic studies have provided compelling evidence that the components of the foraging niche (social egalitarianism, sexual and social division of labour, extensive co-residence and cooperation with unrelated individuals, multilocality, fluid sociality and high between-camp mobility) engendered a unique multilevel social structure where the cognitive mechanisms underlying cultural evolution (high-fidelity transmission, innovation, teaching, recombination, ratcheting) evolved as adaptations. Therefore, multilevel sociality underlies a `social ratchet' or irreversible task specialization splitting the burden of cultural knowledge across individuals, which may explain why human collective intelligence is uniquely able to produce sophisticated cumulative culture. The foraging niche perspective may explain why a complex gene-culture dual inheritance system evolved uniquely in humans and interprets the cultural, morphological and genetic origins of               Homo sapiens               as a process of recombination of innovations appearing in differentiated but interconnected populations.                          This article is part of a discussion meeting issue `The emergence of collective knowledge and cumulative culture in animals, humans and machines'.},

  abstract = {This research is a first attempt to survey ideophones in the Amazonian Arawak language Alto Peren\'e (a.k.a. Ash\'eninka Peren\'e). Based on fieldwork data, this study shows that ideophones constitute a separate class of words in Alto Peren\'e in view of their distinctive phonological, morphological, syntactic, and semantic properties. The study also draws on primary and secondary data from three other genetically related neighboring language varieties (Ash\'eninka Pichis, Ash\'aninka Tambo-Ene, and Kakinte) to demonstrate a moderate degree of interdialect variation. The study suggests the possibility that the following properties may be regional affinities: non-canonical stress assignment; word class-specific reduplication of the word-final syllabic segments -ri, -re, -ro, -pi, -po expressing spatial distribution, intensity, or repeated/durative/open-ended temporal structure of the reported event; productive (V)k-suffixation contributing to the expression of punctual/perfective aspect; syntactic functions of appositional or coordinated predicate, co-verb, complement, and adverb; prevalence of Gestalt packaging of sensory events; a dearth of ideophones describing states.},

It also investigates morphosyntactic means of contrastive focus-marking in two neighboring Kampa languages, Ash\'eninka Pichis and Ashaninka Tambo. The languages are shown to employ various focus-marking strategies. The Alto Peren\'e polar (truth value) focus construction shows a preference for nominalizing a lexical verb. In Ashaninka Tambo, the expression of polar and modal operator focus (the latter attested in negated clauses) does not require nominalization of the lexical verb, but in clefted content and polar questions and affirmative declarative clauses, nominalization is mandatory for the purpose of argument focusing. In Ash\'eninka Pichis, the argument focus-marking strategies include the syntactic movement of the focus constituent to the preverbal focus position and either an elision of the subject index on the verb, or inflecting the verb for stative aspect.},

  abstract = {East Bengali is a language that displays a four-way contrast of voiced/voiceless and aspirated/unaspirated oral stops and affricates in all word positions. Additionally, in intervocalic position there is a quantity contrast between long and short obstruents.             In this production study we investigate medial palato-alveolar affricates and stops at the labial, dental, retroflex, and velar places of articulation and address the problems of VOT measurements. We introduce a different approach of measuring lag times, henceforth called after closure time (ACT). The results show that this approach can do away with the extra notion of breathy voice to distinguish between the voiced aspirates and unaspirates.             Moreover, as a result of analyzing the aspirated stops and affricates, an additional term (superimposed aspiration\textemdash SA) had to be introduced. The results of combining the notions of ACT and SA show that aspiration, measured from the point of release, is timed equally for voiced and voiceless stops. However, the difference in voice emerges in a trade-off relationship between ACT and SA.             The factors used for analysis were voice, aspiration, quantity, and place of articulation in correlation to closure duration, the length of the preceding vowel, ACT, and SA.},

The primary de\textregistered nition of standardization is taken to be the imposition of uniformity upon a class of objects. Attitudes to language within standard language cultures are then reviewed and contrasted with unstandardized situations, in which the boundaries of languages are indeterminate. It is therefore suggested that determinate languages, such as English, may be de\textregistered ned more by ideologies than by their internal structures. Some eects of standardization on the work of linguists are then reviewed. This is followed by a discussion of the importance of the process of legitimization in contributing to the standard language culture, and of the contribution of language specialists themselves to this process. Finally, certain matters arising are reviewed.},

These words are called translation equivalents, and translation equivalents that also sound similar (e.g., banana\textemdash banane) are called cognates. Research has consistently shown that children and adults process and name cognates more easily than non-cognates. The present study explored if there is such an advantage for cognate production in bilinguals' early vocabulary development. Using longitudinal expressive vocabulary data collected from 47 English\textendash French bilingual infants and toddlers starting at the ages of 16\textendash 20 months up to 27 months (a total of 219 monthly administrations in both English and French), results showed that overall children produced a greater proportion of cognate words than non-cognate words on the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories. The findings suggest that cognate learning is facilitated in early bilingual vocabulary development. Just as in monolingual infants, these results suggest that phonological overlap supports bilingual language acquisition.},

  abstract = {As observed by Koptjevskaja-Tamm and Liljegren, the impact of language contact on grammatical typology is well recognized, but the field of lexicosemantic areal typology is still young. Here some mechanisms leading to an areal pattern are explored in the domain of certain sets of basic verbs in languages indigenous to the North American West. The patterns involve the apparent evocation, as part of the meanings of the common verbs, of certain features of the most immediately involved participant, particularly number, animacy, shape, and/or consistency. Two mechanisms apparently underlie the areal patterns. First, bilinguals accustomed to distinguishing such features lexically in verbs in one of their languages may simply choose more specific verbs in another language on a regular basis until, over time, original hyponyms come to be basic level terms. Second, shadows of compounding and derivation can be seen in some pairs of verbs in some languages. Patterns elsewhere in the language or in a neighbor can stimulate such formations and accelerate their lexicalization, ultimately blurring their internal structure and hastening their ascent to basic-level status.},

  abstract = {It is common for languages crosslinguistically to employ the same verb form in several diathetic constructions distinguished by a different degree of agent suppression. In South Slavic languages the so called `quasi-passive reflexive seconstructions' (QRCs) encode a number of non-factual situations, expressing an array of semantically close meanings unified by modal semantics. The paper argues that QRCs in South Slavic languages represent a gradient category comprising potential, normative and generalizing situation types. The difference between these subclasses depends on the degree of implication of the agent in the construction: the agent is indirectly evoked in the potential, its presence can be felt in the normative, and a non-referring agent is present in the generalizing constructions. The intended interpretation of QRCs is obtained through the predicateparticipant relation and pragmatic factors. In shaping the setting the latter may trigger overlapping between the subclasses. The goal of the paper is to prove that QRCs supply the cognitive link between anticausative reflexive (coding autonomous events) and passive reflexive constructions (coding agent defocusing situations): the potential type is closer to anticausatives, while the generalizing type shows affinity with passives. Such scalar analysis of QRCs may contribute to a better understanding of the typology of reflexive constructions.},

  abstract = {A writing system is a graphic code, i.e., a system of standardized pairings between symbols and meanings in which symbols take the form of images that can endure. The visual character of writing implies that written characters have to fit constraints of the human visual system. One aspect of this optimization lays in the graphic complexity of the characters used by scripts. Scripts are sets of graphic characters used for the written form of one language or more. Using computational methods over a large and diverse dataset (over 47,000 characters, from over 133 scripts), we answer three central questions about the visual complexity of written characters and the evolution of writing: (1) What determines character complexity? (2) Can we find traces of evolutionary change in character complexity? (3) Is complexity distributed in a way that makes character recognition easier? Our study suggests that (1) character complexity depends primarily on which linguistic unit the characters encode, and that (2) there is little evidence of evolutionary change in character complexity. Additionally (3) for an individual character, the half which is encountered first while reading tends to be more complex than that which is encountered last.},

The chapter also presents data regarding a distinction between two sorts of nominalizations of psychological and illocutionary verbs that challenge the received view of the identity of the events described by verbs and by (non-gerundive) deverbal nominalizations. These data bear on a distinction between `actions' and `products' introduced by the Polish philosopher Twardowski.},

  abstract = {Human cognition is not solitary, it is shaped by collective learning and memory. Unlike swarms or herds, human social networks have diverse topologies, serving diverse modes of collective cognition and behaviour. Here, we review research that combines network structure with psychological and neural experiments and modelling to understand how the topology of social networks shapes collective cognition. First, we review graph-theoretical approaches to behavioural experiments on collective memory, belief propagation and problem solving. These results show that different topologies of communication networks synchronize or integrate knowledge differently, serving diverse collective goals. Second, we discuss neuroimaging studies showing that human brains encode the topology of one's larger social network and show similar neural patterns to neural patterns of our friends and community ties (e.g. when watching movies). Third, we discuss cognitive similarities between learning social and non-social topologies, e.g. in spatial and associative learning, as well as common brain regions involved in processing social and non-social topologies. Finally, we discuss recent machine learning approaches to collective communication and cooperation in multi-agent artificial networks. Combining network science with cognitive, neural and computational approaches empowers investigating how social structures shape collective cognition, which can in turn help design goal-directed social network topologies.

We present the largest cross-linguistic study on this question to date, drawing on data from nineteen genealogically diverse languages, all investigated in the same behavioral paradigm and using the same stimuli. After controlling for the different dependencies in the data by means of multilevel regression models, we find no evidence that S- vs. V-framing affects nonverbal categorization of motion events. At the same time, statistical simulations suggest that our study and previous work within the same behavioral paradigm suffer from insufficient statistical power. We discuss these findings in the light of the great variability between participants, which suggests flexibility in motion representation. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of accounting for language variability, something which can only be achieved with large cross-linguistic samples.},

  abstract = {Tai Phake (Tai Kadai/Southwestern Tai) has six lexical tones, and nine phonemic vowels plus a length distinction between /a/ and /a{$\Elzlmrk$}/. Following Banchob Bandhumedha (1987), the long /a{$\Elzlmrk$}/ is written as {$<$}\=a{$>$}. The vowel length distinction is only found when there is a final nasal (/m/, /n/, /\ng/), semivowel (/i/, /u/) or stop (/p/, /t/, /k/). Three of the six tones are mid falling tones, which are conventially notated as Tone 3, Tone 4 and Tone 5. Tone 3 is creaky and is primarily distinguished from the others by phonation. Tone 4 is mid falling and short, whereas Tone 5 is mid falling and longer. In the speech of the Tai Phake speakers presented here, the most salient distinction between these two mid falling tones is usually length, thus in citation /n\=a{$^4$}/ `mother`s sister' was half the length of /n\=a{$^5$}/ `melt away'. This paper presents some preliminary findings on the interaction between vowel length and tone length, findings that we hope can lay the foundation for more detailed phonetic studies in the future.},

Participants are asked to make sensibility judgments on sentences by producing movements toward the body or away from the body. The ACE is the finding that movements are faster when the direction of the movement (e.g., toward) matches the direction of the action in the to-be-judged sentence (e.g., Art gave you the pen describes action toward you). We report on a pre-registered, multi-lab replication of one version of the ACE. The results show that none of the 18 labs involved in the study observed a reliable ACE, and that the meta-analytic estimate of the size of the ACE was essentially zero.},

In line with existing analyses of similar oppositions in languages such as Swedish, Danish, Franconian and Estonian, I show that this contrast reflects a difference in metrical structure. Using the framework of Stratal Optimality Theory, I argue that this metrical contrast is derived, and results from faithfulness to foot structure that is built regularly at the stem level, but rendered opaque by subsequent phonological processes. Scottish Gaelic therefore represents an intermediate stage in the diachronic development of underlyingly contrastive metrical structure. This analysis successfully accounts for the complex properties of svarabhakti, a process of copy epenthesis that is intimately connected to the phonological contrast in question, and also sheds light upon the relationship between the oppositions of tonal accent, glottalisation and overlength found in various languages of northern Europe.},

The same can be said of the African (postcolonial) city, which according to Achille Mbembe, is first established as mimetic of the European city, which after a while acquires its own 'aura', a distinct characteristic that makes it truly 'African', even as it well maintains its colonial roots. As an urban cultural expression, hiphop and the city are therefore copulatory, and hip-hop expression is itself a representation of the urban space.},

The first comprehensive modern linguistic field guide was written by Samarin (1967), followed by Bouquiaux and Thomas, Healey (1975), and Kibrik (1977). Apart from Burling's (1984) small but very useful book, Learning a Field Language, there were no fieldwork guides published in the 1980s. Since the early 1990s the rising awareness of the imminent global loss of language diversity, the recognition of linguistic typology as an important discipline of linguistics, and the advances in language recording and processing technology have led to an increasing interest in the documentation of endangered languages and fieldwork methods. These guides have to be distinguished from publications that inform students on the diversity of language structures, or train them through exercises in the analysis of linguistic data. This article briefly explains selected areas of the typology of morphosyntactic structures and gives useful recommendations for further study along with her presentation of data gathering methods. In each section, the morphosyntactic characteristics of Indian languages are explained followed by suggestions about how they can be elicited. The sections in this article recommend a number of books that provide basic and specialized information on languages and language structures and then address anthropologists and other nonlinguistic researchers who are interested in collecting language data in the course of fieldwork. Finally, the article summarizes the state of the art.},

Consequently, the Teop word class system falsifies all word class typologies that assume that a formal differentiation of event, object and property words presupposes a distinctive distribution across the head positions of determiner-marked referential expressions and TAMmarked predicative expressions. In addition to the multifunctionality of verbs, nouns and adjectives, the Teop lexicon shows regular patterns of conversion. The paper concludes with an assessment of the results and the limitations of the corpus-based approach and suggests four topics for further research: (1) the development of elicitation methods to supplement corpus-based analyses; (2) a typology of formally distinguished phrase types; (3) regular patterns of conversion across languages; and (4) possessive comparative constructions.},

The papers collected here make considerable advances in overcoming these restrictions, providing valuable contributions towards the integration of these fields. The increasing evidence for dependencies across the different levels of linguistic structure, and the complexity of the interplay between them, has led to the application of dynamical approaches to spoken language description. With these approaches, coordination and variation within and across systems have begun to play a central role. This paper identifies a common thread through the papers in this issue, in which variation is a consequence of dynamically time-varying behavior that cannot be captured by static snapshots (magic moments).},

Indexes will align with S, A, P, or R arguments, depending on the configuration, but not with the T argument.

Fiftyeight German-speaking respondents were asked to transcribe short extracts from English interviews recorded with Nigerian immigrants and sojourners resident in Germany. In addition to testing comprehension, respondents were requested to rate samples along parameters designed to measure speaker likability and competence. The study's two major findings are that, in spite of the absence of contextual clues, respondents perform better than expected in the comprehension task, but that the single greatest obstacle to comprehension is the presence of German-language material in the stimulus. As realistic English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) interaction in Germany necessarily involves a level of English-German mixing, the experiment thus points to a major practical problem in ELF interaction. The study also yields provisional findings on gender (with male voices being understood better than female ones) and interactions between assumptions about speakers and transcription performance that should be revisited in future research.},

Various chapters discus formal foundations and basic assumptions, describe the evolution of the framework and go into the details of various syntactic phenomena. Separate chapters are devoted to non-syntactic levels of description.

The argument structure represents essential information about potential argument selection and expression, but abstracts away from the actual local phrasal structure. In contrast, phrasal approaches, which are common in Construction Grammar, reject such lexical argument structures. We present evidence for lexical approaches and against phrasal ones: Lexical argument structure is necessary to explain idiosyncratic lexical selection of arguments. Abstraction from phrase structure and word order is shown by passive voice, category conversions, word-level coordination, and partial fronting. Lexical argument structure simplifies the grammar by allowing componential analysis. The phrasal alternative relies on the multiple inheritance of constructions, which is fraught with unsolved problems. Putative evidence for the phrasal approach from acquisition, psycholinguistics, and statistical distribution either fails to distinguish the two approaches, or supports the lexical approach. We conclude in favor of the lexical approach.},

We claim that these are used in the service of active inference in accord with the free-energy principle (FEP). While conceptual advances alongside modelling and simulation work have attempted to connect speech segmentation and linguistic communication with the FEP, we extend this program to the underlying computations responsible for generating syntactic objects. We argue that recently proposed principles of economy in language design\textemdash such as ``minimal search'' criteria from theoretical syntax\textemdash adhere to the FEP. This affords a greater degree of explanatory power to the FEP\textemdash with respect to higher language functions\textemdash and offers linguistics a grounding in first principles with respect to computability. We show how both tree-geometric depth and a Kolmogorov complexity estimate (recruiting a Lempel\textendash Ziv compression algorithm) can be used to accurately predict legal operations on syntactic workspaces, directly in line with formulations of variational free energy minimization. This is used to motivate a general principle of language design that we term Turing\textendash Chomsky Compression (TCC). We use TCC to align concerns of linguists with the normative account of self-organization furnished by the FEP, by marshalling evidence from theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics to ground core principles of efficient syntactic computation within active inference.},

It proposes some parameters of variation within bound lexical morphemes as a class and shows that the \"Aiwoo facts can be best accounted for by reference to these parameters, both in terms of language-internal description and crosslinguistic comparability. It argues that understanding crosslinguistic morphological structure in terms of a dichotomy between ``roots'' and ``affixes'' underplays the existing variation in linguistic structure, and that a more detailed examination is necessary of forms which do not fit clearly into this dichotomy; the discussion of the \"Aiwoo data aims to provide a starting-point for such an examination.},

We present a method which allows for transcription, extracting, coding, preparation for statistical analysis, calculation of some basic frequency statistics, and creation of a concordance all within one program. ELAN is well-established as a valuable tool for language documentation. ELAN is frequently used for transcription and multi-tier mark-up illustrating levels of linguistic structure as well as translations and glosses.

In other words, it is used productively like a suffix in contemporary Japanese. In older Japanese, however, this form was used as a noun. This paper explicates the properties of hoodai and presents the following findings: (i) hoodai strongly prefers a native Japanese word as the word directly preceding it in contemporary Japanese, although it is a Sino-Japanese expression; (ii) hoodai was a noun in the fifteenth century, but it seems to have lost its word status and to have come to be used like a suffix in the latter half of the 19th century; (iii) hoodai can be considered to be still a word in contemporary Japanese on the basis of the notion of ``compound-specific submeaning,'' and expressions of the form X-hoodai are compounds rather than derivatives; (iv) hoodai is an example of grammaticalization involving a cline with respect to compounds; (v) the notion of ``compound-specific submeaning'' plays a role in making a finer distinction between hoodai and itiryuu, etc., and in showing that hoodai is more grammaticalized than the latter words.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the typical focus of analysis in a sound change study across generations: the speech community. I argue that changes in social practices across generations may mean that generational comparisons can be problematic, and these issues are particularly pertinent in small and endangered language communities. Using data from Scottish Gaelic (Celtic, ISO = gla), a minority endangered language of Scotland, I exemplify the challenges posed by the speech community construct via an examination of lateral production across generations of speakers. Gaelic traditionally contrasts three phonemic laterals, but analysis shows that this might be changing. There are two possible directions for sound change in the Gaelic lateral system: results show that younger speakers produce some palatalised laterals as palatal glides without laterality. Meanwhile, the remaining laterals are less acoustically distinct among younger generations, suggesting the possibility of future merger. The construct upon which any apparent- or real-time study of sound change relies is the speech community as a unit of analysis for change. While there are differences among the groups of speakers analysed here, I argue it is potentially problematic to consider this to be a form of sound change due to differences in social practices among generations surrounding Gaelic usage and socialisation. Ultimately, I advocate for a socially-informed approach to sound change study which sympathetically takes local social structure into account.},

  abstract = {This article demonstrates toponymy recording and analyzing placenames in a languagespecific area. Placenames are the most direct link between a language and its territory, current or ancestral. For many speech communities, placenames are an important part of their cultural heritage, encapsulating rights to land and recalling events, activities, and knowledge. Coming to grips with the placenames of a speech community involves understanding its landownership system, and the ways in which the people interact with the land. Knowing something of the history and prehistory of the area is also important, as placenames may be taken over from earlier inhabitants who spoke a different language; even if the earlier inhabitants spoke an earlier form of the modern language, the relevant vocabulary and morphological structures may have changed since the initial bestowal. This is easy to see in the case of languages with written records, such as English, and can sometimes be conjectured in the case of speech communities without written records. This article is directed at the situation of a language as spoken away from an urban area, in rural or more remote landscapes which the speakers have occupied for some generations. Placenames live on as landmarks long after the historical circumstance that made them once important.},

  abstract = {Based on both syntactic and semantic criteria, Stewart (2001) and, following him, Baker and Stewart (1999), distinguish two types of serial verb constructions (SVC) and one type of covert coordination (CC) in Edo. In this article, we present an analysis of these constructions, using Type Logical Grammar (TLG) with an event-based semantic component. We choose as base logic the non-associative Lambek calculus augmented with two unary multiplicative connectives (NL({$\lozenge$}, {$\square$})). SVCs and CCs are interpreted as complex event structures. The complex predicates underlying these structures are derived from simple verbs by means of a constructor. SVCs and CCs differ in terms of which part of the complex event structure is denoted. For SVCs, this is the sum of all events in the structure whereas for a CC this is only the first event in the sequence. The two verbs in an SVC and a CC are treated asymmetrically by assuming that the first verb has an extended subcategorization frame. The additional argument is of type vp (possibly modally decorated). Constraints on word order and the realization of arguments are accounted for using structural rules like permutation and contraction. The application of these rules is enforced by making use of the unary connectives.},

Virtual data collection remains underexplored, as there has never been a widespread need for such practices until the recent lockdowns resulting from the pandemic. Likewise, social media appears to be underutilized as a recruitment tool in linguistic fieldwork. Nevertheless, it is effective in producing a heterogeneous participant sample in a short amount of time. We are delighted to engage in discussions about the effects of virtual recruitment and data collection on linguistic fieldwork and the data itself. We offer a description of our pivots to virtual recruitment and interviewing and the racial justice initiatives that become achievable because of these changes. We hope this contribution is beneficial to researchers looking to incorporate virtual methodologies into their research program.},

We contribute to this discussion with a simulation study where we distinguish two types of spatial processes:               migration               , where populations or languages leave one place for another, and               expansion               , where populations or languages gradually expand their territory. We simulate migration and expansion in two scenarios with varying degrees of spatial directional trends and evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art phylogeographic methods. Our results show that these methods fail to reconstruct migrations, but work surprisingly well on expansions, even under severe directional trends. We demonstrate that migrations and expansions have typical phylogenetic and spatial patterns, which in the one case inhibit and in the other facilitate phylogeographic reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose descriptive statistics to identify whether a real sample of languages, their relationship and spatial distribution, better fits a migration or an expansion scenario. Bringing together the results of the simulation study and theoretical arguments, we make recommendations for assessing the adequacy of phylogeographic models to reconstruct the spatial evolution of languages.},

(2).Mood realizing interpersonal meaning consists of indicative and imperative. It also has mood structure, such as affirmative is S\^P); exclamation is EW\^S\^P; etc. Text appraisal concerns affect, judgment, and appreciation. (3) Theme realizing contextual meaning has three types: topical, interpersonal, and textual theme. Text thematic structure consists of interpersonal theme \^ textual \^ topical theme. Clause relation covers interdependency and logico-semantic. Context of situation covers field, tenor, and mode. The field relates to topics. Every stage has its own topic. Concerning to talking frequency, bride's mediator's status is higher than others. Based on topic discussed, tenors' status is equal.Tenors have closed relationship. Text mode is spoken realized by the use of theme, Text genre is dialog of proposing to a girl. Generic structure covers various stages: pre\textemdash introduction, introduction, content and closing.

  abstract = {Parsing spoken dialogue poses unique difficulties, including disfluencies and unmarked boundaries between sentence-like units. Previous work has shown that prosody can help with parsing disfluent speech (Tran et al., 2018), but has assumed that the input to the parser is already segmented into sentence-like units (SUs), which isn't true in existing speech applications. We investigate how prosody affects a parser that receives an entire dialogue turn as input (a turn-based model), instead of gold standard pre-segmented SUs (an SUbased model). In experiments on the English Switchboard corpus, we find that when using transcripts alone, the turn-based model has trouble segmenting SUs, leading to worse parse performance than the SU-based model. However, prosody can effectively replace gold standard SU boundaries: with prosody, the turn-based model performs as well as the SUbased model (90.79 vs. 90.65 F1 score, respectively), despite performing two tasks (SU segmentation and parsing) rather than one (parsing alone). Analysis shows that pitch and intensity features are the most important for this corpus, since they allow the model to correctly distinguish an SU boundary from a speech disfluency \textemdash{} a distinction that the model otherwise struggles to make.},

  abstract = {Hunting is one of the leading causes of declines in tropical wildlife. Yet, for many traditional and Indigenous Peoples, hunting and associated rituals are integral to establishing and maintaining social identities and reciprocal relations with nature. Taboos that restrict hunting and forest use are widely prevalent in traditional societies and have been likened to informal culture-based conservation mechanisms. However, where taboos have been formally co-opted by conservation programs, the results have been largely ineffective. A recent study showed that taboos in the Idu Mishmi community of Northeast India significantly reduced wild meat consumption and contributed to biodiversity protection, including an endangered tiger population. In this study, we explore what motivates Idu taboos, their role in everyday Idu life, how they impact hunting, and whether they will endure with changing circumstances. We find that by conditioning social and personal prosperity on ancestrally mandated, morally correct behavior in the forest, Idu taboos ensure that people understand that human well-being is inextricably linked to restrictive hunting. Violation of taboo does not just bring misfortune to the violator but to all kin, forging interdependence and cohesion in the society. Taboos form the moral and practical basis of interaction between and among humans, spirits, and animals. Taboos are not an isolated component of the Idu culture; they make the Idu the Idu, the reason why they have endured through rapidly changing times. Conservation should pay careful attention not just to the outcomes of cultural institutions, but to their meanings and processes to co-create sustainable and ethical programs.},

  abstract = {The distinction between direct and indirect speech has long been known not to reflect the crosslinguistic diversity of speech reporting strategies. Yet prominent typological approaches remain firmly grounded in that traditional distinction and look to place language-specific strategies on a universal continuum, treating them as deviations from the ``direct'' and ``indirect'' ideals. We argue that despite their methodological attractiveness, continuum approaches do not provide a solid basis for crosslinguistic comparison. We aim to present an alternative by exploring the syntax of logophoric speech, which has been commonly treated in the literature as representative of ``semi-direct'' discourse. Based on data from two unrelated languages, Wan (Mande) and Ainu (isolate), we show that certain varieties of logophoric speech share a number of syntactic properties with direct speech, and none with indirect speech. Many of the properties of indirect speech that are traditionally described in terms of perspective follow from its syntactically subordinate status. Constructions involving direct and logophoric speech, on the other hand, belong to a separate, universal type of structure. Our findings suggest that the alleged direct/indirect continuum conflates two independent aspects of speech reporting: the syntactic configuration in which the report is integrated, and language-specific meaning of indexical elements.},

This study presents evidence against deriving dominant participle constructions from participles' attributive uses and argues that they should instead be analyzed as a syntactic nominalization in which the participle is the head that agrees with its subject in case. Our account relies on two separate components: (i) a clausal nominalization rule, introduced at the level of phrase structure, and closely resembling the structure of the English gerund; and (ii) a subject agreement rule, treated as a lexical property of Latin participles, and common to all their uses (not just the dominant use). Our synchronic account is supported by diachronic evidence, which suggests that the dominant participle construction developed in Latin through reanalysis of the absolute participle construction (shared by many ancient Indo-European languages). The change involved the introduction of a clausal nominalization rule, while the subject agreement rule was likely present from early on and not affected by the change.},

A suitable method for checking the inter-coder reliability enables researchers to rigorously assess the degree of agreement among two or more independent qualitative coders. By employing this method, researchers can identify mistakes in the content analysis before the codes are used in developing and testing a theory or a measurement model and avoid any associated time, effort and financial cost. However, little guidance is available on what method of inter-coder reliability check should be used. In this paper, we present a critical analysis of these methods that are suitable for qualitative business and management IS research, and provide an example of how we employed the most rigorous method among these methods for a qualitative behavioural IS study.},

In the absence of evidence for a traditional view that languages strive to coordinate either syllables or stress-feet with regular time intervals, we consider the alternative that languages exhibit               contrastive rhythm               subsisting merely in the alternation of stronger and weaker elements. This is initially plausible, particularly for languages with a steep `prominence gradient', i.e. a large disparity between stronger and weaker elements; but we point out that alternation is poorly achieved even by a `stress-timed' language such as English, and, historically, languages have conspicuously failed to adopt simple phonological remedies that would ensure alternation. Languages seem more concerned to allow `syntagmatic contrast' between successive units and to use durational effects to support linguistic functions than to facilitate rhythm. Furthermore, some languages (e.g. Tamil, Korean) lack the lexical prominence which would most straightforwardly underpin prominence of alternation. We conclude that speech is not incontestibly rhythmic, and may even be antirhythmic. However, its linguistic structure and patterning allow the metaphorical extension of rhythm in varying degrees and in different ways depending on the language, and it is this analogical process which allows speech to be matched to external rhythms.},

  abstract = {Striking variation exists in preferences for specific spatial linguistic strategies among different speech communities. Increasing evidence now suggests that this might not simply be a result of neutral drift, but rather a form of linguistic adaptation to the local social, cultural, or physical environment. Recent studies indicate that different factors like topography, subsistence style, and bilingualism successfully predict the choice of spatial frames of reference (FoR) on linguistic and non-linguistic tasks. However, the exact causal relationships between these variables and the cultural evolutionary mechanisms behind the selection of one FoR strategy over another are still not fully understood. In this paper, we argue that to arrive at a more mechanistic and causal understanding of the cultural evolution of spatial language, observations from descriptive fieldwork should be combined with experimental and computational methods. In the framework we present, causal relationships between linguistic and non-linguistic variables (such as FoR choice and topography) can be isolated and systematically tested in order to shed light on how sociotopographic factors motivate the variation in spatial language we observe cross-linguistically. We discuss experimental results from behavioral studies and computer simulations that illustrate how this approach can deliver empirical findings that go beyond simple correlations.},

  abstract = {This paper provides evidence for three Proto Austronesian (PAn) phonemes that are preserved in several distinct languages and subgroups. These include distinctions between *p and *f, *l and *{$\Elzrtll$}, and *k and *g. In addition, we assert that there is expanded evidence in Malayo-Polynesian for two currently recognized phonemes: *{$\Elzrtlt$} (PAn *C) and *c; evidence for the former has been restricted until now to the Formosan languages, and for the latter to a small group of languages in western Indonesia. These contrasts can be found in Nias (one of the Barrier Island languages off the northwest coast of Sumatra), Dohoi (a Northwest Barito subgroup of Borneo), the Western Central Malayo-Polynesian languages of Bimanese, Hawu, Dhao, Western Oceanic, and more sparsely in languages of North Sarawak, the Philippines, and Sumba. The findings presented in this paper highlight the importance of the above languages and subgroups for PAn reconstruction, and the new phonemes presented here are placed within the context of a wider PAn inventory which includes a total of seven places of articulation.},

By considering their performative and depictive qualities with concepts from mindfulness and meditative practices, it is argued that a contemplative, mindful impulse underlies their use by Kichwa-speaking Runa living in Amazonian Ecuador. Using concepts from traditional meditation treatises, a contemporary guided meditation, and contemporary ethnographic research, the paper argues that, whatever else may motivate their articulations of ideophones, whether for expressive, humorous, or dramatic purposes, Kichwa speakers are mindfully and meditatively attending to the rising and falling of ordinary perceptions and giving a voice to the dynamic nature of their lived realities. By voicing the dynamic nature of sensory experiences, speakers are also able, momentarily, to become what they imitate, thereby expressing the perspectives of nonhuman beings according to their sounds, movements, appearances, and energies.},

  abstract = {In the last two decades, many studies have been conducted to investigate speech act performance in general, and apology speech act in particular. This genus of research has focused on western languages. However, more recently a number of studies have been carried out in eastern languages, with only a few in Arabic language varieties. The underlying motivation of speech act studies is to outline the pragmatic rules that govern the use of language in different cultures and to show how findings can be used to facilitate communication between people from different socio-cultural backgrounds. This study is an attempt to outline the type and extent of use of apology strategies in Sudanese Arabic and hence shed light on the sociocultural attitudes and values of this community. The corpus examined was 1082 responses to a Discourse Completion Test (DCT) that consisted of 10 different social situations of varying severity of offense, strength of social relationship and power between hypothetical speakers and hearers. The informants were 110 college educated adults in Khartoum, Sudan. The survey was written in Sudanese dialect to elicit responses that approximate verbal apologies that might be given in these situations. The corpus was analyzed to determine the strategies used and the frequencies of their use. Although this is a pioneering study in its societal context, results support earlier findings suggesting the universality of apology strategies; however, the selection of apology strategies in this study reinforces the culture-specific aspect of language use. Despite the fact that a more restricted classification of apology strategies was used as a model for analyzing the data, the results are expected to be conducive to cross-cultural comparisons.},

  abstract = {Positive mood often facilitates cognitive functions. Facilitation is hypothesized to be due to an increase in dopamine occurring in positive mood states. However, facilitation has not been consistently found in studies of cognitive flexibility. This inconsistent relationship may reflect the numerous ways cognitive flexibility is measured. Moreover, there is evidence that the role of dopamine in cognitive flexibility performance depends on the type of measure used. In the current study, we employed a probabilistic two-card reversal learning task (n = 129) and a Stroop-like task switching procedure (n = 188) in a college student population. We used a standardized set of mood videos to induce a positive, negative, or neutral mood state. Negative mood states were included to account for possible effects of arousal on performance, which is seen in both positive and negative mood inductions. Based on current theories of positive mood and cognition, we hypothesized that there would be differences in the effects of a positive mood induction on cognitive flexibility as assessed by task switching and reversal learning tasks. The mood induction successfully induced high levels of amusement and increased valence in the positive mood group and high levels of repulsion and decreased valence in the negative mood group. However, there were no differences in cognitive flexibility across any of the mood groups, as assessed by switch costs in task switching and correct choices after the reversal in reversal learning. Overall, these findings do not support the hypothesis that positive mood improves cognitive flexibility.},

The chapter proposes an architecture for a system that meets these requirements. The working memory system consists of a declarative and a procedural part, each of which has three embedded components: the activated part of long-term memory, a component for creating new structural representations by dynamic bindings (the ``region of direct access'' for declarative working memory, and the ``bridge'' for procedural working memory), and a mechanism for selecting a single element (``focus of attention'' for declarative working memory, and ``response focus'' for procedural working memory). The architecture affords two modes of information processing, an analytical and an associative mode. This distinction provides a theoretically founded formulation of a dual-process theory of reasoning.},

  abstract = {One of the more noticeable changes to tertiary teaching over the past decade has been the widespread adoption of digital technologies, in particular eLearning platforms and lecture capture technology. However, much of the current knowledge of how students utilise these new technologies and their effect on traditional lecture attendance is simply derived from student surveys rather than comprehensive independent analyses. In this study, we use cluster analysis to identify common lecture resource utilisation patterns for students in four large firstyear business subjects. While common usage patterns with respect to lecture attendance, video lecture recording access and download of lecture notes are identified across our subjects, the proportion of students within each of the utilisation clusters varies widely. Business statistics students are much more likely to either attend lectures or view video recordings compared to economics students, many of whom rely solely on the download of lecture notes. In order to gain insight into how student characteristics may affect these utilisation patterns, we develop a predictive model, quantifying the influences of prior academic performance, gender, age, distance from campus and international student status using statistical modelling. We find a strong role for students' previous academic performance in explaining lecture resource utilisation patterns. Students' commuting distance to campus is also established as a factor dissuading physical lecture attendance. Contrary to initial expectations, we also found that females and older students tend to rely more heavily on digital resources rather than lecture attendance. It is hoped that these findings can help first-year instructors and University administrators understand the heterogeneity of student lecture engagement patterns within the first-year experience.},

One widely-used method is the recording of lectures delivered during face-toface teaching of on-campus courses. The recordings are subsequently made available to students on-line and have been variously referred to as lecture capture, video podcasts, and Lectopia. We examined the literature on lecture recordings for on-campus courses from the perspective of students, lecturers, and the institution. Literature was drawn from major international electronic databases of Elsevier ScienceDirect, PsycInfo, SAGE Journals, SpringerLink, ERIC and Google Scholar. Searches were conducted using key terms of lecture capture, podcasts, vodcasts, video podcasts, video streaming, screencast, webcasts, and online video. The reference sections of each article were also searched and a citation search was conducted. Institutions receive pressure from a range of sources to implement web-based technologies, including from students and financial imperatives, but the selection of appropriate technologies must reflect the vision the institution holds. Students are positive about the availability of lecture recordings. They make significant use of the recordings, and the recordings have some demonstrated benefits to student learning outcomes. Lecturers recognise the benefits of lecture recordings for students and themselves, but also perceive several potential disadvantages, such as its negative effect on attendance and engagement, and restricting the style and structure of lectures. It is concluded that the positives of lecture recordings outweigh the negatives and its continued use in higher education is recommended. However, further research is needed to evaluate lecture recordings in different contexts and to develop approaches that enhance its effectiveness.},

The third sentence was either in accord with the story or an unusual occurrence (depending on exchange of subject and object). The most important experimental finding was that both number and length of unfilled pauses are more frequent throughout the unusual stories as compared with the usual ones. In the readings, the effect was limited to the critical sentence and the pauses immediately thereafter.

An examination of languages' phonologies can therefore yield insights into the mechanisms of coarticulation. In this paper I discuss (a) the need to differentiate between phonological processes that are and are not due to coarticulation, (b) the need to differentiate between `on-line' synchronic variation and comparable fossilized diachronic variation, (c) how to determine some of the constraints on coarticulation \textendash{} especially the higher priority of maintaining acoustic-auditory, rather than articulatory, norms for the shape of speech elements, and (d) how coarticulation presents a ``parsing'' problem to the listener and, of course, to systems for automatic speech recognition.},

An oral production paradigm was carried out in which Spanish\textendash English bilinguals produced words with initial voiceless stops as non-switched tokens, code-switched tokens in an otherwise monolingual context, and code-switched tokens in a bilingual context. Results demonstrated a degree of phonetic transfer associated with code-switching, either unidirectional or bi-directional. Specifically, English, with long lag VOT, was more susceptible to phonetic transfer than Spanish (short lag). Contrary to expectations, while the code-switching effect was present in both monolingual and bilingual mode, there was no additional transfer, or additive effect, of bilingual language mode. Differences in the effects of code-switching on English and Spanish are discussed with respect to the inherently different acceptable VOT ranges in the two languages. Furthermore, the lack of difference in VOT between the code-switched tokens in the monolingual and bilingual contexts is taken to suggest limits on phonetic transfer.},

First, I give an overview of NP structure in the language, which is characterized by extremely limited possibility of elaboration and modification. I connect this to the observation that Papuan languages are characterized by exceptionally simple NP structures. The lack of research makes it difficult to evaluate the significance of such observations, but I suggest that Coastal Marind is an example of a Papuan language that imposes very strict upper boundaries on NP complexity. Second, while an argument could be made that Coastal Marind NPs allow considerable discontinuity, more thorough consideration of the facts reveals a fundamental, tight-knit, left-branching NP structure, which contrasts with relatively rarely employed looser nominal configurations, including discontinuous nominal expressions. The discontinuous construals are restricted primarily by information structure. Although considered grammatical by speakers, they are extremely rare in corpus data. I propose that aboutness is an important factor constraining the choice of nominal construal types in Coastal Marind discourse.},

Knowledge about possible verb-based restrictions on noun incorporation may, however, provide important insights for theoretical approaches to noun incorporation, in particular regarding the question to what extent incorporation is a lexical or a syntactic process, and whether and how languages may vary in this respect. This paper therefore investigates to what extent languages restrict noun incorporation to particular verbs and what types of restrictions appear to be relevant cross-linguistically. The study consists of two parts: an explorative typological survey based on descriptive sources of 50 incorporating languages, and a more detailed investigation of incorporating verbs in corpus data from a sample of eight languages, guided by a questionnaire. The results demonstrate that noun incorporation is indeed restricted in terms of which verbs allow this construction within and across languages. The likelihood that a verb can incorporate is partly determined by its degree of morphosyntactic transitivity, but the attested variation across verbs and across languages shows that purely lexical restrictions play an important role as well.},

In this paper, we argue that the distinctive features of human culture derive from humans' unique skills and motivations for coordinating with one another around different types of action and information. As different levels of these skills of `shared intentionality' emerged over the last several hundred thousand years, human culture became characterized first by such things as collaborative activities and pedagogy based on cooperative communication, and then by such things as collaborative innovations and normatively structured pedagogy. As a kind of capstone of this trajectory, humans began to coordinate not just on joint actions and shared beliefs, but on the reasons for what we believe or how we act. Coordinating on reasons powered the kinds of extremely rapid innovation and stable cumulative cultural evolution especially characteristic of the human species in the last several tens of thousands of years.

Good empirical evidence exists for both 'computed' and 'large stored' forms in language, but little is known about what shapes multi-word storage / access or compositional processing. Here we explored whether predictive and retrodictive processes are a likely determinant of multi-word storage / processing. Our results suggest that forward and backward predictability are independently informative in determining the lexical cohesiveness of multi-word phrases. In addition, our results call for a reevaluation of the role of retrodiction in contemporary language processing accounts (cf. Ferreira and Chantavarin 2018).},

In contrast, the negative morpheme comes late in the clause in Japanese; thus it would seem that recipients need to hold in memory all the material in the clause               preceding               the negative until the negative morpheme is produced. Several features of Japanese grammar, however, suggest that this characterization is not accurate. We argue that prosody, grammar, cognition, processing, and fixedness all interact with the grammar of clause organization to afford quite different real-time processing strategies for calculating the assignment of negative scope in languages with different `word order' norms.},

  abstract = {This study examines speakers' reaction to focally applied temporal real-time auditory feedback perturbation in a word-initial unstressed syllable (Unstressed condition) and a similar word-medial stressed syllable (Stressed condition) in a three-syllabic word. Speakers compensate locally in both conditions for the perturbed syllable's nucleus (V; compressed by the perturbation) but not for the complex onsets (CC; stretched by the perturbation). The perturbation of the first, unstressed syllable causes a global slowing down of all segments following the perturbation (syllable two and three), while the perturbation in the Stressed condition elicits local adjustments only in the perturbed (second) syllable. When viewed in a larger prosodic context, the timing strategy in the Unstressed condition indicates that speakers aim to keep relative durations within the word constant when the word-initial onset is auditorily stretched, leading to a compensatory pattern for both CC and V in word-proportional durations. In the Stressed condition, increasing the stressed vowel's duration seems to be of the highest priority, causing all other segments to take up a shorter portion within the word. Adaptation effects of the stressed vowel indicate a durational representation on the segment level. Further adaptation effects additionally suggest a representation of timing/coordination in larger prosodic units. Complementary investigation of aperiodicity, spectral skewness, and intensity (RMS) indicates that spectral properties can change along with compensatorily increased duration.},

  abstract = {During conversation, speakers modulate characteristics of their production to match their interlocutors' characteristics. This behavior is known as alignment. Speakers align at many linguistic levels, including the syntactic, lexical, and phonetic levels. As a result, alignment is often treated as a unitary phenomenon, in which evidence of alignment on one feature is cast as alignment of the entire linguistic level. This experiment investigates whether alignment can occur at some levels but not others, and on some features but not others, within a given dialogue. Participants interacted with two experimenters with highly contrasting acoustic-phonetic and syntactic profiles. The experimenters each described sets of pictures using a consistent acoustic-phonetic and syntactic profile; the participants then described new pictures to each experimenter individually. Alignment was measured as the degree to which subjects matched their current listener's speech (vs. their non-listener's) on each of several individual acoustic-phonetic and syntactic features. Additionally, a holistic measure of phonetic alignment was assessed using 323 acoustic-phonetic features analyzed jointly in a machine learning classifier. Although participants did not align on several individual spectral-phonetic or syntactic features, they did align on individual temporalphonetic features and as measured by the holistic acoustic-phonetic profile. Thus, alignment can simultaneously occur at some levels but not others within a given dialogue, and is not a single phenomenon but rather a constellation of loosely-related effects. These findings suggest that the mechanism underlying alignment is not a primitive, automatic priming mechanism but rather guided by communicative or social factors.},

Tboli is a language spoken by people living in southwestern Mandanao, Philippines, in the province of South Cotabato. The pedagogical grammar of Tboli has been written to help non-Tboli speakers interested in learning to speak Tboli. In the chapter on Bantoanon phonology, discussion focuses on higher level phonology, syllable patterns, the phoneme, and residue. Topics addressed in the chapter on Aklanon narratives include the spatial relation between speaker and hearer, the discourse functions of demonstratives, syntactic pointing, and connotative or emotive functions of demonstratives. The final chapter is an analysis of behavioral texts (speech directed obligatorily to a second person in a communication situation) and a discussion of the persuasive devices employed by the speakers in an effort to effect a change in the listener's behavior. Several nonlinguistic persuasive devices are described: appeal to the cultural norm, human relationship, coaxing, and indirectness. (JP).},

  abstract = {Pitch peaks tend to be higher at the beginning of longer than shorter sentences (e.g., `A farmer is pulling donkeys' vs `A farmer is pulling a donkey and goat'), whereas pitch valleys at the ends of sentences are rather constant for a given speaker. These data seem to imply that speakers avoid dropping their voice pitch too low by planning the height of sentence-initial pitch peaks prior to speaking. However, the length effect on sentence-initial pitch peaks appears to vary across different types of sentences, speakers and languages. Therefore, the notion that speakers plan sentence intonation in advance due to the limitations in low voice pitch leaves part of the data unexplained. Consequently, this study suggests a complementary cognitive account of length-dependent pitch scaling. In particular, it proposes that the sentence-initial pitch raise in long sentences is related to high demands on mental resources during the early stages of sentence planning. To tap into the cognitive underpinnings of planning sentence intonation, this study adopts the methodology of recording eye movements during a picture description task, as the eye movements are the established approximation of the real-time planning processes. Measures of voice pitch (Fundamental Frequency) and incrementality (eye movements) are used to examine the relationship between (verbal) working memory (WM), incrementality of sentence planning and the height of sentence-initial pitch peaks.},

The present study aimed to determine peoples' self-reported experience of insight in their daily lives. Using an online questionnaire, responses were obtained from 1,114 respondents. Eighty-percent reported having insights. These respondents reported demographic information and answered three open-ended questions on where their insights occur, what insights are and other thoughts on insight. A greater percentage of those who have insights are, female, younger, highly educated, and involved in occupations including, management, sciences, arts and service professions. The qualitative results uncovered eight major themes, reflecting on the places people have insights: At night, work, shower, home, when it is quiet, transport, while exercising, and in nature. Two major themes emerged on what insights are: Something from the subconscious, and a result of (not) thinking. Finally, three major themes emerged from the third question on thoughts they would like to share on insight: The improvement of insight with age, the importance of analyzing the details of the problem, and the unexpectedness of the solution. Results are discussed in the context of the current experimental research on insight.},

Yet, this corpus-based study of DOM and the associated prosody finds that DOM is not based on information structure alone, but is also additionally motivated by discourse structure and content management. The suggested analysis proposes that DOM in Burmese provides a grammatical structure of information packaging: a system of separating information into units (packages) and establishing relations between them. Different configurations of packaging are employed to create an array of context-dependent interpretive effects related to information structure, discourse structure, and other factors. Hence, it is argued that information structure is not directly expressed in the language. Instead, it stems from an interpretation of the interplay between information packaging and various pragmatic-semantic factors, and is but one of the possible effects created by packaging.},

The two contours are (a) a Response-Seeking contour (RS), pronounced as a strongly accented rise-fall on the last syllable of the Intonation Unit and (b) Prosodic Intensification (PI), minimally pronounced as an identical deviant accent and maximally characterised by an abrupt shift into an extra-high pitch level (or a falsetto voice) and/or an extreme rhyme lengthening. RS has phatic, interactionmanaging functions and PI triggers content-managing interpretations. Both markers index (in the Peircean sense) the investment of the speaker's extra-effort, thus drawing the interlocutors' attention and triggering an interpretive (PI) or responsive (RS) action. The study analyses RS and PI as conventional/symbolic indexicals (akin to a prosodic pointing) where on the one hand the form is naturally related to the triggered meaning but on the other hand the form of the marker, its distribution and the set of its functions are language-specific conventions. The study presents a brief crosslinguistic comparison of parallel indexical-iconic prosodic contours and demonstrates how despite their non-arbitrary nature, such markers have conventionalised forms, distribution and functions. The study adds to the growing evidence for the role of nonarbitrariness in language and interaction.},

They found that children learn to speak in language-specific ways from age 3 onward (i.e., English speakers used 1 clause and Turkish speakers used 2 clauses to express manner and path). In contrast, English- and Turkish-speaking children's gestures looked similar at ages 3 and 5 (i.e., separate gestures for manner and path), differing from each other only at age 9 and in adulthood (i.e., English speakers used 1 gesture, but Turkish speakers used separate gestures for manner and path). The authors argue that this pattern of the development of cospeech gestures reflects a gradual shift to language-specific representations during speaking and shows that looking at speech alone may not be sufficient to understand the full process of language acquisition.},

Second, we focus on five media tantum verbs, i.e., forms that synchronically carry the -r suffix and have no counterpart without -r. Unlike most other verbs, these five forms are labile, i.e., they can occur in syntactically intransitive and transitive constructions with no (supra-)segmental change. After describing the valence patterns in which Bribri media tantum labile (MTL) verbs occur, we investigate whether: (i) their nonabsolutive arguments behave like ergative phrases; and whether (ii) MTL verb forms in two-argument constructions behave like active voice transitive verb stems. Third, we outline a hitherto unnoticed diachronic path for the rise of lability in a small subgroup of Bribri media tantum verbs.},

Understanding the processes of diversification and homogenization that produce these patterns has been a fundamental aim of linguistics and anthropology. Empirical research to date has identified various social, environmental, geographic, and demographic factors associated with language richness3. However, our understanding of causal mechanisms and variation in their effects over space has been limited by prior analyses focusing on correlation and assuming stationarity3,8. Here we use process-based, spatially-explicit stochastic models to simulate the emergence, expansion, contraction, fragmentation, and extinction of language ranges. We varied combinations of parameter settings in these computer-simulated experiments to evaluate the extent to which different processes reproduce observed patterns of pre-colonial language richness in North America. We find that the majority of spatial variation in language richness can be explained by models in which environmental and social constraints determine population density, random shocks alter population sizes more frequently at higher population densities, and population shocks are more frequently negative than positive. Language diversification occurs when populations split after reaching size limits, and when ranges fragment due to population contractions following negative shocks or due to contact with other groups that are expanding following positive shocks. These findings support diverse theoretical perspectives arguing that language richness is shaped by environmental and social conditions, constraints on group sizes, outcomes of contact among groups, and shifting demographics driven by positive innovations, such as new subsistence strategies, or negative events, such as war or disease.},

Yet, phonetic studies that include bilingual speakers of Indigenous languages remain rare. This paper analyzes phonetic transfer in Dine\textasciiacute{} Bizaad (Navajo), a Dene language indigenous to North America. Specifically, I examine the evidence for intergenerational change and convergence with English in the release period durations of Dine\textasciiacute{} affricated stops [kx, tx]. The analysis is based on tokens of Dine\textasciiacute{} [kx, tx] and English [kh, th] extracted from recent interviews with 51 Dine\textasciiacute -English bilinguals. Release durations of targeted sounds are measured, compared with earlier analogous measurements, and statistically analyzed to assess age effects. Participants, especially younger speakers, are predicted to produce Dine\textasciiacute{} [kx, tx] with shorter releases than earlier measurements, and with releases that align more with similar English sounds. Data confirm that speakers pronounce Dine\textasciiacute{} [kx], but not [tx], with shorter durations; younger participants also produce [kx] with the shortest releases, and with durations closest to English [kh]. Results suggest that perceptual similarity between velar sounds leads to phonetic convergence, but alveolar sounds are sufficiently distinct to prevent transfer. Together, findings attest to the relevance of minority language contexts to theories of bilingual phonology.},

  abstract = {Hoava sa and ria have been analysed as pronouns in some contexts, and articles in others, an apparent case of flexibility in functional categories. However, this analysis depends on an assumption that pronouns are NP head. An alternative analysis employing the Determiner Phrase (DP) demonstrates that in all contexts sa/ria occupy the same syntactic position: DP head. They are always pronouns, alternating with articles in D, an analysis supported by evidence that 1st/2nd pronouns behave in an identical way. This unified analysis gives no grounds for positing membership of separate categories. In contrast, in Standard Fijian (SF) articles and pronouns occupy different syntactic positions: SF pronouns are not in D, but in N. The paper concludes that structures such as DP have considerable descriptive power; pronouns behave variably across Oceanic; and Hoava sa/ria are pronouns in all contexts. Their apparent flexibility was an artefact of earlier analyses, not a feature of the grammar.},

Electroglottography (EGG) supplements acoustic data on disyllabic words with checked tones collected from 40 speakers from five dialect regions. The results indicated that a final coda can be realized as a full oral/glottal stop closure, an energy dip at vowel's end, an aperiodic voicing at vowel's end, or a coda deletion. Over 80\% of /{$\Elzglst$}/ codas and less than 20\% of /               p               t               k               / codas were deleted.

Glottal contact quotient (CQ\_H) distinguished tones 3 and 5 from unchecked tones 31 and 51, respectively. In sandhi positions, the vowels of tone [5] /3/ were produced with a longer CQ\_H, lower H1*-A3* and a higher Cepstral Peak Prominence (CPP), suggesting a longer close phase, a more abrupt glottal closure and more periodic voicing than tone [3] /5/. In juncture position, coda deletion and the merging of H1*-A1*, H1*-A3* and A1*-A2* of tones [3] /3/ and [5] /5/ suggest a sound change among checked tones.},

Here, we show that another measure, the Shannon entropy of a type frequency distribution, has a different relationship with sample size, one that allows meaningful analysis in a wider range of circumstances. Once the sample gets large enough, entropy stabilises at interpretable values. In contrast to the existing measures, this behaviour allows the entropy scores of samples of different sizes to be sensibly compared. Entropy's stabilisation is due to an intriguing property of type frequency distributions, namely their self-similarity: even when sample size changes, the shape of the distribution itself does not. We also include empirical comparisons of entropy to three standard productivity measures\textemdash type count, potential productivity, and S\textemdash and provide a tentative conceptual validation of entropy as a productivity measure, showing with a Bayesian regression model that entropy picks up on important aspects of what it means for a morpheme to be productive.},

These definitions fail to capture the many ways that binary gender can be encoded in the grammar and lexicon crosslinguistically. Drawing from data on twelve typologically distinct languages, I argue that a reimagined theory of gender in language which centers the concept of social gender must be constructed in order to empirically situate the concept of gender-inclusive language. Data on the realization of gender-inclusivity in different languages is essential in this task, as it identifies the features of language that speakers determine to mark gender and signals the capacity of a gendered language to change.},

In some languages (e.g. English), manner of motion is typically encoded within the verb, while direction of motion information appears in modifiers. In other languages (e.g. Greek), the verb usually encodes the direction of motion, while the manner information is often omitted, or encoded in modifiers. We designed two studies to investigate whether these language-specific patterns affect speakers' reasoning about motion. We compared the performance of English and Greek children and adults (a) in nonlinguistic (memory and categorization) tasks involving motion events, and (b) in their linguistic descriptions of these same motion events. Even though the two linguistic groups differed significantly in terms of their linguistic preferences, their performance in the nonlinguistic tasks was identical. More surprisingly, the linguistic descriptions given by subjects within language also failed to correlate consistently with their memory and categorization performance in the relevant regards. For the domain studied, these results are consistent with the view that conceptual development and organization are largely independent of language-specific labeling practices. The discussion emphasizes that the necessarily sketchy nature of language use assures that it will be at best a crude index of thought. q 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Languages differ in how they encode motion. When describing bounded motion, English speakers typically use verbs that convey information about manner (e.g., slide, skip, walk) rather than path (e.g., approach, ascend), whereas Greek speakers do the opposite. We investigated whether this strong cross-language difference influences how people allocate attention during motion perception. We compared eye movements from Greek and English speakers as they viewed motion events while (a) preparing verbal descriptions or (b) memorizing the events. During the verbal description task, speakers' eyes rapidly focused on the event components typically encoded in their native language, generating significant cross-language differences even during the first second of motion onset. However, when freely inspecting ongoing events, as in the memorization task, people allocated attention similarly regardless of the language they speak. Differences between language groups arose only after the motion stopped, such that participants spontaneously studied those aspects of the scene that their language does not routinely encode in verbs. These findings offer a novel perspective on the relation between language and perceptual/cognitive processes. They indicate that attention allocation during event perception is not affected by the perceiver's native language; effects of language arise only when linguistic forms are recruited to achieve the task, such as when committing facts to memory.},

Despite the obvious importance of this process, relatively few studies to date have explored how conceptual representations are formed prior to speaking. Here we present a programme of research that tackles this question, focusing on the domain of events. Three key findings emerge. First, conceptual event structure shows important homologies with language. Second, given that event encoding differs across languages, the assembly of event representations prior to speaking varies cross-linguistically. Finally, conceptualising an event for purposes of communication depends not only on conceptual and linguistic factors but also on the pragmatic assessment of the needs and knowledge of the speaker's conversational partner. We sketch implications of this integrated approach to event conceptualisation for future research on how thought is transformed into language.},

In this paper, we take a quantitative approach to the study of orientation systems by presenting the results of an exploratory multifactorial analysis of spatial orientation systems across 131 Austronesian languages, representing nearly all available data on orientation systems for the family. We analyze these data using multinomial logistic regression to uncover correlations between orientation type and four predictor variables representing cultural and environmental factors: geographic distribution, economy, geography (proximity to the sea), and ruggedness of terrain. Our model suggests that while not entirely predictive of the type of orientation system, the factors geography and economy alone account for much of the variation among spatial orientation systems in our sample, supporting a ``weak'' form of the Sociotopographic Model (Palmer, Bill, Jonathon Lum, Jonathan Schlossberg \& Alice Gaby. 2017. How does the environment shape spatial language? Evidence for sociotopography. Linguistic Typology 21(3). 457\textendash 491).

Study 1 showed that, when reading a speaker's preference as text, participants tended to choose whatever was said last as matching the speaker's preference, reflecting the recent-mention bias of anaphora resolution. In Study 2, we asked whether this pattern changed for audio versions of our stimuli. We found that it did not. We then asked whether observers used gesture to disambiguate the speaker's preference. Participants watched videos in which two statements were spoken. Co-speech gestures were produced during each statement, in two different locations. Next, an ambiguous preference for one option was spoken. In `gesture disambiguating' trials, this statement was accompanied by a gesture in the same spatial location as the gesture accompanying the first statement. In `gesture non-disambiguating' trials, no third gesture occurred. Participants chose the first statement as matching the speaker's preference more often for gesture disambiguating compared to non-disambiguating trials.

  abstract = {The term ``construction'' is not a label to be assigned randomly, but presupposes a structural analysis with an associated set of syntactic and semantic properties. Based on this premise, the term ``serial verb construction'' (SVC) as currently used in Chinese linguistics will be shown to simply refer to any multiverb surface string i.e,. to subsume different constructions. The synchronic consequence of this situation is that SVCs in Chinese linguistics are not commensurate with SVCs in, e.g., Niger-Congo languages, whence the futility at this stage to search for a ``serialization parameter'' deriving the differences between so-called ``serializing'' and ``non-serializing'' languages. On the diachronic side, SVCs are invoked as a privileged site for verb-to-preposition reanalysis, but it is left open what structure is referred to under this label. A precise structural analysis of both the input and the output structure is, however, indispensable in order to make meaningful statements about language change.},

  abstract = {Diversity in African Languages contains a selection of revised papers from the 46th Annual Conference on African Linguistics, held at the University of Oregon. Most chapters focus on single languages, addressing diverse aspects of their phonology, morphology, semantics, syntax, information structure, or historical development. These chapters represent nine different genera: Mande, Gur, Kwa, Edoid, Bantu, Nilotic, Gumuzic, Cushitic, and Omotic. Other chapters investigate a mix of languages and families, moving from typological issues to sociolinguistic and inter-ethnic factors that affect language and accent switching. Some chapters are primarily descriptive, while others push forward the theoretical understanding of tone, semantic problems, discourse related structures, and other linguistic systems. The papers on Bantu languages reflect something of the internal richness and continued fascination of the family for linguists, as well as maturation of research on the family. The distribution of other papers highlights the need for intensified research into all the language families of Africa, including basic documentation, in order to comprehend linguistic diversities and convergences across the continent. In this regard, the chapter on Daats'\'iin (Gumuzic) stands out as the first-ever published article on this hitherto unknown and endangered language found in the Ethiopian-Sudanese border lands.},

It is common cross-linguistically for languages to make fewer contrasts in negative clauses than in affirmative ones. In this paper we focus on the less expected appearance of the ergative case in certain negated irrealis clauses, where the use of this case would be ungrammatical in the corresponding affirmative clauses. We sketch the aspectual and casemarking systems of the language, and then present data exemplifying the interaction of case, aspect and polarity, including the use of the ergative with arguments of monovalent verbs in negated irrealis clauses. We conclude by offering an account for the behaviour observed in terms of the pragmatics of implicature.},

  abstract = {One areal feature of East and Southeast Asian languages is the grammaticalization of an augmentative-diminutive pair from the nominals `mother' and `child', respectively (Matisoff 1992). Many Sino-Tibetan languages further grammaticalize noun-class affixes from these kinship nominals, adding a parallel `father' analogy in the process. Some Tibeto-Burman (TB) languages further grammaticalize the resulting kinship trio into numeral classifiers and lexical and clausal nominalizers. This paper presents evidence from the Ngwi branch of Burmic demonstrating a novel, yet parallel, polygrammaticalization process involving `youth' (from TB *lak) as an analogous lexical source. Data from 30 languages inform a gradient reconstruction of two integrated, parallel clines: a nominal suffix series, YOUTH {$>$} SPROUT {$>$} SLENDER {$>$} OBLONG {$>$} GENERIC, complemented by a numeral classifier series, YOUTH(S) {$>$} AFFINAL KIN {$>$} CONSANGUINEAL KIN {$>$} NARROW {$>$} GENERIC. Both paths underlie the emergence of a collectivizing clausal nominalizer. The results support an emerging consensus: Analogy, automation and diagrammatic causation are irreducibly interdependent components of grammaticalization.},

In a new twist, however, on the evolution of give verbs, we demonstrate that the benefactive usage is extended to malefactive semantics in a distinct, derived structure, conditioned via the expression of possession, a type of malefactive that is not well-documented in current literature on this domain. Furthermore, the existence of two distinct constructions for the benefactive and the malefactive in Jinghpo conforms to Radetzky \& Smith's claim (2010:\,116) that this is an areal feature comprising the Indian subcontinent, Southeast and East Asia, and thus contrasts strongly with the conflation of both types of construction in many European languages. Finally, we propose that the nuclear type of serialization, integral to the typological profile of Jinghpo, a SOV language, is a determining factor in the reanalysis of ya33. This feature is subsequently invoked to explain why the malefactive usage of ya33 constitutes a separate development from the well-attested pathway for give verbs leading to permissive causative verbs and adversative passive markers, which, while blocked in Jinghpo, is commonly found in many other East and Southeast Asian languages with core serialization. The present analysis is based on the variety of Jinghpo spoken in Luxi County, Yunnan Province, China, using, in the main, natural discourse data collected in the field.},

  abstract = {This study examines the influence of lexical tone on voice onset time (VOT) in Mandarin and Hakka spoken in Taiwan. The examination of VOT values for Mandarin and Hakka word-initial stops /p, t, k, ph, th, kh/ followed by three vowels /i, u, a/ in different lexical tones revealed that lexical tone has significant influence on the VOT values for stops. The results are important as they suggest that future studies should take the influence of lexical tone into account when studying VOT values and when designing wordlists for stops in tonal languages. In Mandarin, stops' VOT values, from the longest to the shortest, are in MR, FR, HL, and HF tones. This sequence is the same as in Liu, Ng, Wan, Wang, and Zhang (2008). Later, however, it was found that it is very likely that the sequence results from the existence of non-words. In order to produce non-words correctly, participants tended to pronounce them at a slower speed, especially those in MR tone. Therefore, we further examined the data without non-words, in which no clear sequence was found. For Hakka, post-hoc tests (Scheffe) show that aspirated stops in entering tones, which are syllables ending with a stop, have significantly shorter VOT values than they have in other tones. Although the tonal effects on VOT values are not consistently found in different sets of data, probably due to a methodology problem, the possibility of tonal effect on VOT values could not be excluded. Tonal effect, thus, should be taken into consideration in designing word lists for VOT studies. Moreover, further studies should include both real words and non-words in separate sets of word lists to verify the current study results.},

An important point for future research is to examine the interface between iconic prosody and the latent iconic features of words and signs that are frozen in the linguistic system.},

Results show that, like other individual differences (ID) variables, the age factor behaves like a dynamic entity that changes over time and affects L2 literacy development differentially at different times. Furthermore, while an early age of first bilingual language exposure has no effect on the L2 development for the children in the minimal CLIL program, early-AO bilinguals in the partial CLIL program (age of first exposure 5) outperform the older-AO bilingual group (age of first exposure 7 and 9) in terms of accuracy and (syntactic and morphological) complexity but not in terms of lexical richness and fluency.},

It describes the syntax, semantics and discourse functions of Thai bare classifier phrases, and further proposes a diachronic account of their origin in reduction of post-posed numeral `one'. Following this synchronic and diachronic description, this article attempts to locate Thai within a working typology of bare classifier constructions in mainland Asian languages, and further argues for the importance of bare classifier constructions to the theory of classifiers more generally. Following Bisang (1999) and others, it argues that bare classifier constructions reveal the core function of classifiers in Asian languages to be INDIVIDUATION \textendash{} a referential function. It therefore cautions against some recent proposals to merge classifiers and gender markers within a single categorical space defined on the semantic basis of nominal classification, and in favour of continuing to treat classifiers as a discrete linguistic category \textendash{} in mainland Asian languages, at least.},

In the language sciences, a ubiquitous form of such repetition is structural priming, a tendency to repeat or better process a current sentence because of its structural similarity to a previously experienced (``prime'') sentence (Bock, 1986). The recent explosion of research in structural priming has made it the dominant means of investigating the processes involved in the production (and increasingly, comprehension) of complex expressions such as sentences. This review considers its implications for the representation of syntax and the mechanisms of production, comprehension, and their relationship. It then addresses the potential functions of structural priming, before turning to its implications for first language acquisition, bilingualism, and aphasia We close with theoretical and empirical recommendations for future investigations.},

  abstract = {Currently, production and comprehension are regarded as quite distinct in accounts of language processing. In rejecting this dichotomy, we instead assert that producing and understanding are interwoven, and that this interweaving is what enables people to predict themselves and each other. We start by noting that production and comprehension are forms of action and action perception. We then consider the evidence for interweaving in action, action perception, and joint action, and explain such evidence in terms of prediction. Specifically, we assume that actors construct forward models of their actions before they execute those actions, and that perceivers of others' actions covertly imitate those actions, then construct forward models of those actions. We use these accounts of action, action perception, and joint action to develop accounts of production, comprehension, and interactive language. Importantly, they incorporate well-defined levels of linguistic representation (such as semantics, syntax, and phonology). We show (a) how speakers and comprehenders use covert imitation and forward modeling to make predictions at these levels of representation, (b) how they interweave production and comprehension processes, and (c) how they use these predictions to monitor the upcoming utterances. We show how these accounts explain a range of behavioral and neuroscientific data on language processing and discuss some of the implications of our proposal.},

(1999). These findings also pose the question of whether similar differences hold for allegedly homophonous affixes (instead of free lexemes). Earlier experimental research found some evidence that morphemic and non-morphemic sounds may differ acoustically (Walsh \& Parker 1983, Losiewicz 1992). This paper investigates this question by analyzing the phonetic realization of non-morphemic /s/ and /z/, and of six different English /s/ and /z/ morphemes (plural, genitive, genitive-plural and 3rd person singular, as well as cliticized forms of has and is). The analysis is based on more than 600 tokens extracted from conversational speech (Buckeye Corpus, Pitt et al. 2007). Two important results emerge. First, there are significant differences in acoustic duration between some morphemic /s/'s and /z/'s and non-morphemic /s/ and /z/, respectively. Second, there are significant differences in duration between some of the morphemes. These findings challenge standard assumptions in morphological theory, Lexical Phonology and models of speech production.},

More recently{$\mkern1mu$}, the `temporal mesoscale' of speech has been explored, specifically regularities in the envelope of the acoustic signal that correlate with syllabic information and that play a central role in production and perception processes. The temporal structure of speech at this scale is remarkably stable across languages, with a preferred range of rhythmicity of 2\textendash{} 8\,Hz. Importantly, this rhythmicity is required by the processes underlying the construction of intelligible speech. A lot of current work focuses on audio-m otor interactions in speech, highlighting behavioural and neural evidence that demonstrates how properties of perceptual and motor systems, and their relation, can underlie the mesoscale speech rhythms. The data invite the hypothesis that the speech motor cortex is best modelled as a neural oscillator, a conjecture that aligns well with current proposals highlighting the fundamental role of neural oscillations in perception and cognition. The findings also show motor theories (of speech) in a different light, placing new mechanistic constraints on accounts of the action\textendash perception interface.},

This study takes its starting point in resonance in stance-taking sequences with the aim to account for the interplay between intersubjective motivations and cognitive facilitation in resonance production. It analyzes stance-taking sequences in the London\textendash Lund Corpus 2, determining (i) the type of stance alignment (agreement or disagreement), and (ii) the time lapse between the stance-taking turns. The main findings are, firstly, that resonance is more likely than non-resonance to be used by speakers who express disagreement than agreement, which we interpret as a mitigating function of resonance, and, secondly, that the turn transitions are faster in resonating sequences due to cognitive activation in the prior turn. We propose that the face-saving intersubjective motivation of resonance combines with its facilitating cognitive effect to promote appeasing communication.},

  abstract = {Food is a great conversation opener, whether at parties or in an academic forum, and a great topic for gathering data. The language of food is a topic on which most people have a view, whether subjective or objective, implicit or explicit, from the inside or outside. The field of food study exists down the street or in some distant community. An interested fieldworker can gather information from friends, neighbours, in schools, supermarkets, and restaurants, or just about anywhere, asking `What is your favourite food?' and so on. This chapter explores the `languages of food' as they communicate variations of messages about the meanings of food. The local or internal messages, exemplified in this article in Marshallese are contrasted with three external messages: `civilized eating' as the concern of early outsiders such as missionary wives; economists' approaches largely concerned with production of food; and nutrition education messages about `good' food. These alternative approaches reflect Douglas's idea that `every spoken sentence rests on unspoken knowledge for some of its meaning'. In order to focus on significant differences in approaches to food and eating that anthropologists have brought to the fore, the concept of gastronomy is elaborated upon stating that gastronomic protocols that govern the use of chopsticks or serving food on a palm leaf, or serving food in the correct hierarchical sequence, are all notable features that send messages about the wider society.},

The facts from Galo thus support a view of language in which ``word'' is independently defined in phonological and grammatical terms, and in which neither type of ``word'' necessarily corresponds to (or is projected by) the other. Although there might be said to exist a very generalized functional pressure towards ``unification'' of ``phonological words'' and ``grammatical words'', such a pressure would not be expressible as a formal constraint on language grammar.},

This article proposes a common explanation for both facts, by hypothesizing that reanalysis of an AUX-final serial verb construction as a single predicate word has resulted in realignment of an earlier pre-head auxiliary negator as a predicate suffix with leftward scope over the predicate stem. This is similar to another channel found in some Tibeto-Burman languages in which a prefixal negator fuses with a clause-final auxiliary to become a suffix (as in Kuki-Chin and `Naga'); however, I argue it to be ultimately somewhat different. These arguments are made on the basis of a more comprehensive description of negation in Galo (Tibeto-Burman {$>$} Tani, Eastern Himalaya) than was provided in Post (2007); as such, a second goal of the paper is to contribute to the typology of negation in Asian languages more generally.},

  abstract = {Topographical deixis' refers to a variety of spatial-environmental deixis in which typically distal reference to entities is made in terms of a set of topographically-anchored referential planes: most often, upward, downward, or on the same level. Thus defined, topographical deixis is a pervasive feature of Trans-Himalayan (= Sino-Tibetan) languages. However, while there have been several descriptions of Trans-Himalayan topographical deixis at the language or subgroup level, there has been as yet no account of its overall status and distribution within the family. The primary goal of this paper is to provide an account of topographical deixis from a pan-Trans-Himalayan perspective, to the maximum extent possible on the basis of existing descriptions. It discusses its formal coding, functions, distribution within the family, and environmental correlations. In addition to providing a benchmark account of the nature and distribution of topographical deixis within the Trans-Himalayan family, this study thus contributes to cross-linguistic typologies of spatial deictic systems and their environmental-interactional motivations more generally.},

We highlight three features in particular \textendash{} vowel length, nasality and a glottal stop \textendash{} which contribute to contrastively-weighted syllables in Apatani, which are consistently under-represented in previous descriptions of Apatani, and in absence of which tone in Apatani cannot be effectively analysed.

Two appendices provide a set of diagnostic procedures for the discovery and description of Apatani tone categories, as well as an Apatani lexicon of approximately one thousand entries.},

  abstract = {Conversational turn taking in humans involves incredibly rapid responding. The timing mechanisms underpin\- ning such responses have been heavily debated, including questions such as who is doing the timing. Similar to findings on rhythmic tapping to a metronome, we show that floor transfer offsets (FTOs) in telephone conver\- sations are serially dependent, such that FTOs are lag-1 negatively autocorrelated. Finding this serial dependence on a turn-by-turn basis (lag-1) rather than on the basis of two or more turns, suggests a counter-adjustment mechanism operating at the level of the dyad in FTOs during telephone conversations, rather than a more individualistic self-adjustment within speakers. This finding, if replicated, has major implications for models describing turn taking, and confirms the joint, dyadic nature of human conversational dynamics. Future research is needed to see how pervasive serial dependencies in FTOs are, such as for example in richer communicative face-to-face contexts where visual signals affect conversational timing.},

The Visual Mandela Effect (VME) is a Mandela Effect specific to visual icons (e.g., the Monopoly Man is falsely remembered with a monocle) and has not yet been empirically quantified or tested. In Experiment 1 (N=100), we demonstrate that certain images from popular iconography elicit consistent, specific false memories. In Experiment 2 (N=60), using eye-tracking-like methods, we find no attentional or visual differences that drive this phenomenon. There is no clear difference in the natural visual experience of these images (Experiment 3), and these VME-errors also occur spontaneously during recall (Experiment 4; N=50). These results demonstrate that there are certain images for which people consistently make the same false memory error, despite majority of visual experience being the canonical image.},

The argument begins with a brief assessment of the promise of optimization-based approaches, focusing on issues of explanation from principle. The general lay-out of Optimality Theory is sketched, including the core notions of ranking \&amp; violability and the emphasis on universality in the constraint set.Part I shows how the ideas play out over a variety of phenomena and generalization patterns. The key distinction between Markedness and Faithfulness constraints is introduced. The analytical focus is on empirical phenomena ranging from epenthesis to infixation to a variety of sometimes-complex interactions between prominence, syllabification, stress, and word form. Part I concludes with a formal presentation of the theory.Part II investigates the theory of syllable structure. It begins with a study of the basic Jakobson typology and moves on to present an analysis of aspects of the Lardil phonological system which incorporates the results of the basic theory. The section concludes with a detailed exploration of a generalized theory based on multipolar scales of sonority-to-syllable-position affinity.Part III examines the derivation of universal and language particular inventories, provides discussion of foundational issues, and concludes with analysis of the relation between Optimality Theory and theories using a notion of repair.},

  abstract = {The so-called passive in M\"aori has been the topic of a long-standing debate in the linguistics literature. Its frequency, especially in past tense narratives, makes this construction an atypical passive. It has been suggested that the passive in M\"aori is used with perfective (Clark 1973) and dynamic (Bauer 1997) events, and when the clause contains an affected direct object (Chung 1978). This thesis finds that all of these suggestions are correct, but, rather than a passive construction, it is ergative, so that M\"aori has split-ergativity. As predicted under the Transitivity Hypothesis (Hopper \& Thompson 1980), the most transitive clauses in M\"aori have ergative marking, and less transitive clauses are accusatively marked. Transitivity is understood as a property of an entire clause, involving a number of factors, and the most important features of transitivity in M\"aori are PARTICIPANTS, AFFECTEDNESS OF O, ASPECT and PUNCTUALITY. Clauses that are low in transitivity are uniformly accusative, in both their morphology and syntax. However, highly transitive clauses, which we expect to follow ergative alignment, have some evidence of syntactic accusativity. This mixed behaviour follows directly from the Inverse Grammatical Relations Hypothesis (Manning 1996). Manning claims syntactic constructions like control, binding and imperative addressee are accusatively aligned in all languages, because they are restricted at argument structure. Languages can only be ergative at the level of grammatical relations, where syntactic processes such as relative clauses, question formation and topicalisation are restricted. It then follows that ergativity is only present in M\"aori at gr-structure in the most highly transitive clauses. We also look at M\"aori from a diachronic perspective, and see that it differs from its Eastern Polynesian sisters, which are all accusative. M\"aori is different because the extension of the imperfective pattern did not spread to all transitive clauses, thus preventing a reanalysis of imperfective clauses as active.},

In the past, the Sihan were hunter-gatherers; however, nowadays they are settled mainly in three locations in Belaga. The language appears to be similar to other Punan languages, although the degree of mutual intelligibility is difficult to determine as these languages are spoken in widely-dispersed places across Borneo.},

  abstract = {Speakers have been hypothesized to organize discourse content so as to achieve communicative efficiency. Previous work has focused on indirect tests of the hypothesis that speakers aim to keep per-word entropy constant across discourses to achieve communicative efficiency (Genzel \& Charniak, 2002). We present novel and more direct evidence by examining the role of topic shift in discourse planning. If speakers aim for constant per-word entropy, they should encode less unconditional per-word entropy (as estimated based on only sentenceinternal cues) following topic shifts, as there is less relevant context to condition on. Applying latent topic modeling to a large set of English texts, we find that speakers are indeed sensitive to the recent topic structure in the predicted way.},

While some linguists claim that in a nested epistemic expression one modal is semanti\- cally embedded within the scope of the other modal based on the word order, it is possible that in daily conversation the scope of nested modals may not be thoroughly processed, leading to a ``good-enough'' interpretation that is not sensitive to the word order of the two modals. This study used probability judgment tests to investigate people's interpretation of nested epistemic expressions, and the effect of word order was not observed. This result fails to support the scope account of the nested epistemic expressions and suggests a holistic processing mechanism in line with the good-enough processing framework.},

A typologically interesting phenomenon occurs in a sequence of two Agutaynen pronouns in a Patient-Voice (transitive) clause, whereby Patients consisting of a first- or second-person pronoun occur first, violating the ``expected'' order of Actor-first (in Genitive form) and replacing it with Actor-last (in Oblique form). Agutaynen has three basic types of nominal markers for personal noun phrases: Nominative, Genitive and Oblique. Markers for common noun phrases show variation in each type, however. A definite/indefinite distinction in the ``Genitive'' leads to the analysis of Agutaynen tang as a Definite marker. Further variation in the ``Nominative'' and ``Oblique'' forms are also considered. Agutaynen makes a three-way, tense/aspect distinction--Perfective, Imperfective and Contemplated\textemdash easily demonstrated through the mag- set of Actor-voice (intransitive) prefixes. Two aspectual particles (da and pa) and one modal particle (din) are also considered.},

Awara uses verbal suffixes for all of these, as well as employing multi-verb constructions for four aspectual distinctions. Two past tenses, the present tense, and one future tense are marked. Distinguishing between the present tense suffix and the homophonous imperfective aspect suffix is a thorny issue in Awara morphology. The suffixes marking mood and modality belong to two classes of irrealis suffixes, which are similar in form to irrealis suffixes of other Finisterre-Huon languages. Awara is noteworthy for a grammatical distinction between static and dynamic verb classes, realized in different forms of imperfective aspectual suffixes.},

Such research is not the domain of a single type of organization but can be conducted by a range of different entities in both the public and private sectors. Given that the use of personal data may be indispensable for many forms of research, the data protection framework will play an important role in determining not only what types of research may occur but also which types of actors may carry it out. This article looks at the role the EU's General Data Regulation plays in determining which types of actors can conduct research with personal data. In doing so it focuses on the various legal bases that are available and attempts to discern whether the GDPR can be said to favour research in either the public or private domains. As this article explains, the picture is nuanced, with either type of research actor enjoying advantages and disadvantages in specific contexts.},

  abstract = {Many existing intonation studies tend to be unenlightening for three main reasons. First, they do not acknowledge that intonational variation may be functionally significant. By effectively ignoring functional variation among accents, investigators therefore run the risk of missing explanations for variation which may be theoretically important. The question of degree of perceptual relevance in intonational variation is not considered in detail here, although the basic assumption is that intonation is capable of performing a range of roles. Second, few studies attempt to provide a detailed explanation of the model they have used for analysing intonation. This means that there is no way of knowing whether, for instance, nuclearity in one accent is realised in identical ways in other accents, or even whether the concept of nuclearity is applicable in other varieties. Finally, existing accounts offer little information which is useful for developing intonational typologies. Clearly, this is a consequence of the failure to recognise variation and to provide an agreed analytic model. The present article addresses the shortcomings mentioned above and points towards a means of overcoming them by highlighting the need for a systematic phonological approach to intonation analysis.},

One effect of the alternation is the different linking of grammatical relations and semantic roles, which affects the identity of the subject. This paper investigates the meaning-preserving hypothesis in voice alternation in Indonesian from a quantitative usagebased perspective by combining corpus-based data with sentence-production experiment data. It analysed Indonesian CAUSED FORWARD/BACKWARD MOTION verbs and the distribution of their (non-)metaphoric senses in active and passive. The findings demonstrate the frequency effects and sense-sensitivity of voice alternation, such that a given voice type of a verb is strongly associated with certain senses. This finding provides initial support for a previous study on voice alternation in an Austronesian language, predicting that the verb's semantic properties may condition the statistical bias of the verb towards a particular voice. Some convergence between experimental and corpus findings indicates that participants demonstrate some representation of the strong association between a given voice form of the verb and the sense predominantly expressed in that form, highlighting the notion of item-specific representations of linguistic knowledge as found in construction grammar.},

The maximal subevental structure consists of a stative predication embedding a dynamic one, and the dynamic one in turn embedding a stative one. This structure and its proper subsets exhaust the event types built by the grammar. These principles ensure the relative prominence of the different argument positions as well as specific entailments for the different positions.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        When speakers of two or more languages interact, they are likely to influence each other: contact leaves traces in the linguistic record, which in turn can reveal geographic areas of past human interaction and migration. However the complex, multi-dimensional nature of contact has hindered the development of a rigorous methodology for detecting its traces. Specifically, other factors may contribute to similarities between languages. Inheritance (a property is passed from an ancestor to several descendant languages), and universal preference (a property is universally preferred), may both overshadow contact signals. How can we find geographic contact areas in language data, while accounting for the confounding effects of inheritance and universal preference? We present             sBayes             , an algorithm for Bayesian clustering in the presence of confounding effects. The algorithm learns which similarities in a set of features are better accounted for by confounders, and which are due to contact effects. Contact areas are free to take any shape or size, but an explicit geographic prior ensures their spatial coherence. We test the clustering method on simulated data and apply it in two case studies to reveal language contact in South America and the Balkans. Our results are supported by \textemdash mostly qualitative\textemdash{} findings from previous studies. While we focus on the specific problem of language contact, the method can also be used to uncover other traces of shared history in cultural evolution, and more generally, to reveal latent spatial clusters in the presence of confounders.},

The thematic and aspectual constraints on the two types of secondary predicate and their hosts are detailed, as are the semantic constraints on the relation between the main verb and each of the secondary predicate types and the structural representation of these relations. The final sections focus on the issue of the argument or adjunct status of the different types of depictive and resultative (such as true versus false resultative) predicates, the role of each type in the event structure representation, and the possibility of distinguishing between secondary predicates and certain adverbial types. As noted by the studies reviewed in this chapter, an examination of secondary predicate constructions sheds light on properties of verb and adjective types, the characterization of argument versus adjunct, and the thematic and aspectual underpinnings of event structure.},

It is argued that numerous factors lead to grammaticalization of these verbs, including context, the semantic class of the verbs, and their frequency. A corpus-based analysis shows that these aspectual verbs have been grammaticalized in different ratios during the last one hundred years, demonstrating ongoing change in the Persian language.},

  abstract = {Understanding worldwide patterns of language diversity has long been a goal for evolutionary scientists, linguists and philosophers. Research over the past decade has suggested that linguistic diversity may result from differences in the social environments in which languages evolve. Specifically, recent work found that languages spoken in larger communities typically have more systematic grammatical structures. However, in the real world, community size is confounded with other social factors such as network structure and the number of second languages learners in the community, and it is often assumed that linguistic simplification is driven by these factors instead. Here, we show that in contrast to previous assumptions, community size has a unique and important influence on linguistic structure. We experimentally examine the live formation of new languages created in the laboratory by small and larger groups, and find that larger groups of interacting participants develop more systematic languages over time, and do so faster and more consistently than small groups. Small groups also vary more in their linguistic behaviours, suggesting that small communities are more vulnerable to drift. These results show that community size predicts patterns of language diversity, and suggest that an increase in community size might have contributed to language evolution.},

We take into consideration both monosyllabic and disyllabic sets of words and claim that Sylheti has three lexical level tones: high, mid, and low. We have built linear mixed-effect models of f0 and duration to examine the acoustic correlates of tone contrast in the language. We conclude that Sylheti has a three-way tonal contrast distinctively affecting pitch.},

We argue that such non-anaphoric reference can be understood as motivated by a central principle: the expression of agency in interaction. In developing this claim, we draw upon research in what may initially appear a wholly unconnected domain: the marking of epistemic and deontic stance, standardly investigated in linguistics as turn-level grammatical phenomena. Examination of naturally-occurring talk reveals that to analyze such stances solely though the lens of turn-level resources (e.g., modals) is to address only partially the means by which participants make epistemic and deontic claims in everyday discourse. Speakers' use of referential expressions illustrates a normative dimension of grammar that incorporates both form and position, thereby affording speakers the ability to actively depart from this form-position norm through the use of a repeated NP, a grammatical practice that we show is associated with the expression of epistemic and deontic authority. It is argued that interactants can thus be seen to be agentively mobilizing the resources of grammar to accommodate the inescapable temporality of interaction.},

When considering homesign and sign languages in rural areas, this typology needs further refinement. Here, I present new concepts to enable this. The study is based on fieldwork with twelve deaf people in Western Highlands, Papua New Guinea, and review of studies worldwide. Sign language communities can be mapped as               sign networks               . Using this mapping, I propose a new typological category for languages with one central deaf user and many fluent hearing signers:               nucleated network sign language               . I use               sign base analysis               to determine lexical consistency between unconnected deaf signers in Western Highlands. The high level of consistency among largely unconnected deaf people is explained by a               regional sign network               connecting deaf and hearing signers. This research emphasises the role of both deaf and hearing signers in sign language emergence and maintenance.

  abstract = {Allophonic palatalisation of velar consonants in Chilean Spanish has been hastily attributed to the inevitable anticipatory assimilation that occurs between a back consonant and front vowel. In this study, the extent of palatalisation of the voiceless velar fricative /x/ was measured before /e/ and /i/, in male and female speakers, and in controlled and casual speech, to ascertain the relationship between palatalisation, the gender of the speaker and the speech style, from a variationist standpoint. Using reading and interview tasks, a total of 1586 /x/ tokens were taken from 14 participants from Santiago. Results show a significant drop in frequency (indicative of lesser palatalisation) in casual speech from males, but not in casual speech from female speakers. Concurrently, the following vowel also influenced the degree of palatalisation. It can be proposed that palatalisation is dictated to an extent by articulatory effort and caution, linked to differences in sociolinguistic behaviours of both genders. [h] has also been registered as a more infrequent allophone of /x/, serving as a replacement for [x] and [\c{c}].},

  abstract = {The region of the ancient Sahul continent (present day Australia and New Guinea, and surrounding islands) is home to extreme linguistic diversity. Even apart from the huge Austronesian language family, which spread into the area after the breakup of the Sahul continent in the Holocene, there are hundreds of languages from many apparently unrelated families. On each of the subcontinents, the generally accepted classification recognizes one large, widespread family and a number of unrelatable smaller families. If these language families are related to each other, it is at a depth which is inaccessible to standard linguistic methods. We have inferred the history of structural characteristics of these languages under an admixture model, using a Bayesian algorithm originally developed to discover populations on the basis of recombining genetic markers. This analysis identifies 10 ancestral language populations, some of which can be identified with clearly defined phylogenetic groups. The results also show traces of early dispersals, including hints at ancient connections between Australian languages and some Papuan groups (long hypothesized, never before demonstrated). Systematic language contact effects between members of big phylogenetic groups are also detected, which can in some cases be identified with a diffusional or substrate signal. Most interestingly, however, there remains striking evidence of a phylogenetic signal, with many languages showing negligible amounts of admixture.},

This paper draws on the material that is now available to reconstruct various features of the morphosyntax of the parent of the group, Proto-Northern Luzon. Evidence for the unity of the group will first be examined, noting that there is little phonological evidence to unite the family, although the largest group of languages within the family, those which comprise what has been called Meso-Cordilleran does share certain phonological innovations. There is however a fairly substantial body of exclusively-shared lexical innovations which have been claimed to be reconstructible to Proto-Northern Luzon. The general typological features of clausal constructions, both transitive and intransitive, as well as non-verbal, found throughout Northern Luzon will be considered to be reconstructible to the parent language. Two major sections of the paper will deal with the reconstruction of the case relations of NP complements of these clause types, one dealing with pronominal exponents of NPs and the other dealing with nominal specifiers, sometimes referred to in the literature as determiners. A bottom-up approach to reconstruction will be utilized, moving from reconstruction of the lower-level groupings to the parent, Proto-Northern Luzon, but a top-down approach will also be integrated, especially when dealing with various, commonly-occurring grammaticalization processes.},

  abstract = {This paper tackles the challenge of how to identify multi-word (or ``complex'') nominal expressions in flexible word order languages including certain Australian languages and Vedic Sanskrit. In these languages, a weak or absent noun/adjective distinction in conjunction with flexible word order make it often hard to distinguish between complex nominal expressions, on the one hand, and cases where the nominals in question form independent expressions, on the other hand. Based on a discourse-based understanding of what it means to form a nominal expression, this paper surveys various cases where we are not dealing with multi-word nominal expressions. This involves, in particular, periphery-related phenomena such as use of nominals as free topics or afterthoughts, as well as various kinds of predicative uses. In the absence of clear morpho-syntactic evidence, all kinds of linguistic evidence are relied upon, including, in particular, information structure and prosody, but also derivational morphology and lexical semantics. In this way, it becomes frequently possible to distinguish between what are and what aren't complex nominal expressions in these languages.},

Based on a comparative investigation of the historical development of a class of Indo-European spatial adverbs, we argue that mismatches between layers of linguistic structure present one type of situation in which grammaticalization may be blocked. For grammaticalization to occur, the outer semantic-syntactic boundaries of the potentially grammaticalizing construction must be matched by prosodic boundaries. If prosodic chunking is shifted in relation to semantic-syntactic chunking, grammaticalization may be prevented.},

  abstract = {This chapter offers a descriptive analysis of the morphological forms that make up the base paradigm of Shilluk transitive verbs, and also of the functions that are expressed through them. With respect to morphological exponence, tone and vowel length play a central role, both in marking the functions and in distinguishing a total of seven different verb classes. As for the functions, they are syntactic voice, subject marking, and tense-aspect-modality (TAM). These functions interact with one another and with other aspects of the syntax of the clause. For example, Imperfective aspect is only available in Object voice, and certain TAM forms interact with focus marking. We pay special attention to syntactic alignment, a topic on with earlier analyses diverge. Older studies distinguish between active and passive voices (Westermann 1912, Tucker 1955). More recently, the passive has been reinterpreted as an ergative construction (Miller \& Gilley 2001). We find that the construction at the center of the controversy has all the morphosyntactic properties of a passive, but not the information-structural characteristics. The scope of this chapter is restricted to the base inflectional paradigm. This means that it does not cover the many derivations which present inflectional paradigms that are largely parallel to the base paradigm. For the sake of clarity and accountability, sound examples are embedded in relation to each of the numbered illustrations.},

Each of these six derivations presents its own set of forms marked for voice, subject, and tense-aspect-modality. The current chapter presents a descriptive analysis of the two derivations that mark associated motion. Apart from the patterns of morphological exponence, we also describe the morphosyntactic characteristics that are associated with these derivations.

  abstract = {From a young age, children go through a stage of leveling irregular forms. They are also known to probability-match variable phenomena. However, it is still unclear how children treat phenomena that are both irregular and variable. Does their tendency to overregularize take over, leading them to seize on the regular occurrences and produce them at an even higher rate than adults, or do children probability-match in these cases? In order to study this question, we turn to the variably voiced plurals of English nouns that end in a voiceless fricative, like leaves, houses, and paths. We find that children seem to probability-match for /s/-final and /\texttheta/-final stems (e.g. houses, paths), but not for /f/-final stems (e.g. leaves). This finding has implications for our understanding of first language acquisition, and how learners acquire words with multiple processing requirements.},

This partitioning of continuous activity may occur, in part, because events correspond to dynamic patterns that have recurred across different contexts. Recurring patterns may lead to reliable sequential dependencies in observers' experiences, which then can be used to guide perception. The current set of simulations investigated whether this statistical structure within events can be used 1) to develop stable internal representations that facilitate perception and 2) to learn when to update such representations in a selforganizing manner. These simulations demonstrate that experience with recurring patterns enables a system to accurately predict upcoming stimuli within an event, to identify boundaries between such events based on transient increases in prediction error, and to use such boundaries to improve prediction about subsequent activities.},

It is surprising to find the huge amount of literature existing on the scholarly aspects of ethics in fieldwork \textemdash{} namely the imperative for fieldwork on endangered languages in order to have records of the languages. This surge of interest around ethics in linguistic fieldwork is likely closely related to the impact of changes in social science research more generally on linguistics, where there has been increased interest in participatory action and community-based research in recent years, as well as to the developing influence of indigenous methodologies on linguistic fieldwork. Many linguistic fieldworkers, like others in social science areas, are attempting to move away from an `expert subject' model to more collaborative types of research. The study examines ethics with respect to ethic codes, individuals, codes, communities, languages beginning with a dictionary definition of ethics followed by research with people. This is followed by an overview of ethical codes relevant to linguistic fieldwork focusing on traditional questions. Subsequently the article questions concerning the responsibilities of the linguist in the field.},

In a survey of 44 genetically and areally diverse languages, we have tracked synchronic usage patterns for 54 allative markers and confirmed that they indeed exhibit a wide range of semantic and grammatical functions. A number of previous grammaticalization studies undertaken from a cognitive/typological perspective have argued that various non-spatial goalmarking senses of allative morphemes, such as dative/benefactive and purposive, often develop out of a spatial sense through various semantic extensions. Our data also indicated that allatives grammaticalize extensively, but that dative, purposive, and other common abstract extensions, perhaps strongly associated with the allative sense, have an equal \textendash{} and thus independent \textendash{} likelihood of developing. That is, their functional evolution is not fully predetermined by a single implicational hierarchy or by a unidimensional grammaticalization chain. Instead, an allative marker undergoing grammaticalization has multiple extension pathways available to it.},

  abstract = {Advanced learning in ill-structured domains is frequently based on multiple documents that contain conflicting information and opposing perspectives on the same or related issues (such as multiple texts belonging to a scientific controversy). In such cases, cognitive flexibility can be defined as the ability to develop a justified point of view by adopting some arguments and rejecting others on rational grounds. I will suggest that learners can achieve this goal only if they actively and strategically validate incoming text information against previously acquired knowledge and beliefs (epistemic validation) (statement 1). Up to now, the cognitive processes underlying epistemic validation have not been addressed by the major theories in the fields of text comprehension and learning from text. I will introduce a simple process model according to which epistemic validation rests on two types of cognitive processes, (automatic) epistemic monitoring and (strategic) epistemic elaboration (statement 2). Epistemic monitoring means that learners regularly and efficiently monitor incoming text information for internal consistency and plausibility. In many cases, learners tend to refute new information that conflicts with their prior knowledge or information acquired earlier. Alternatively, learners who are motivated and able to do so may engage in an effortful and strategic epistemic elaboration of arguments that are initially evaluated as implausible. Finally, I will propose that learners' epistemological beliefs serve as declarative metacognition that is crucial for engagement in epistemic elaboration. As such, epistemological beliefs determine whether learners achieve cognitive flexibility in learning with multiple texts (statement 3).},

  abstract = {Information structure is a relatively new field to linguistics and has only recently been studied for smaller and less described languages. This book is the first of its kind that brings together contributions on information structure in Austronesian languages. Current approaches from formal semantics, discourse studies, and intonational phonology are brought together with language specific and cross-linguistic expertise of Austronesian languages. The 13 chapters in this volume cover all subgroups of the large Austronesian family, including Formosan, Central Malayo-Polynesian, South Halmahera-West New Guinea, and Oceanic. The major focus, though, lies on Western Malayo-Polynesian languages. Some chapters investigate two of the largest languages in the region (Tagalog and different varieties of Malay), others study information-structural phenomena in small, underdescribed languages. The three overarching topics that are covered in this book are NP marking and reference tracking devices, syntactic structures and information-structural categories, and the interaction of information structure and prosody. Various data types build the basis for the different studies compiled in this book. Some chapters investigate written texts, such as modern novels (cf. Djenar's chapter on modern, standard Indonesian), or compare different text genres, such as, for example, oral narratives and translations of biblical narratives (cf. De Busser's chapter on Bunun). Most contributions, however, study natural spoken speech and make use of spoken corpora which have been compiled by the authors themselves. The volume comprises a number of different methods and theoretical frameworks. Two chapters make use of the Question Under Discussion approach, developed in formal semantics (cf. the chapters by Latrouite \&amp; Riester; Shiohara \&amp; Riester). Riesberg et al. apply the recently developed method of Rapid Prosody Transcription (RPT) to investigate native speakers' perception of prosodic prominences and boundaries in Papuan Malay. Other papers discuss theoretical consequences of their findings. Thus, for example, Himmelmann takes apart the most widespread framework for intonational phonology (ToBI) and argues that the analysis of Indonesian languages requires much simpler assumptions than the ones underlying the standard model. Arka \&amp; Sedeng ask the question how fine-grained information structure space should be conceptualized and modelled, e.g. in LFG. Schnell argues that elements that could be analysed as ``topic'' and ``focus'' categories, should better be described in terms of `packaging' and do not necessarily reflect any pragmatic roles in the first place.},

  abstract = {We provide a robust and detailed annotation scheme for information status, which is easy to use, follows a semantic rather than cognitive motivation, and achieves reasonable inter-annotator scores. Our annotation scheme is based on two main assumptions: firstly, that information status strongly depends on (in)definiteness, and secondly, that it ought to be understood as a property of referents rather than words. Therefore, our scheme banks on overt (in)definiteness marking and provides different categories for each class. Definites are grouped according to the information source by which the referent is identified. A special aspect of the scheme is that non-anaphoric expressions (e.g. names) are classified as to whether their referents are likely to be known or unknown to an expected audience. The annotation scheme provides a solution for annotating complex nominal expressions which may recursively contain embedded expressions. In annotating a corpus of German radio news bulletins, a kappa score of .66 for the full scheme was achieved, a core scheme of six top-level categories yields {$\kappa$} = .78.},

We formulate a number of constraints, which allow the analyst/annotator to derive QUDs from the previous or upcoming discourse context, and demonstrate the method using corpus examples (of French, German, and English). Since we avoid making reference to language-specific morphosyntactic or prosodic properties, we claim that our method is also cross-linguistically applicable beyond our example languages.},

Members of flexible word classes are characterized by their vague semantics, which in the case of nouns means that values for the semantic features Shape and Homogeneity are either left undetermined or they are specified in such a way that they do not quite match the properties of the kind of entity denoted by the flexible item in the external world. I will then argue that flexible word classes constitute a proper category (i.e. they are not the result of a merger of some rigid word classes) in that members of flexible word categories display the same properties regarding category membership as members of rigid word classes. Finally this article wants to claim that the distinction between rigid and flexible noun categories (a) adds a new dimension to current classifications of parts-of-speech systems, (b) correlates with certain grammatical phenomena (e.g. so-called number discord), and (c) helps to explain the parts-of-speech hierarchy.},

Among our findings are a revision and expansion of the known aspect system, along with identification of tense marking and sensitivity to aspect in the voice system. Polarity and mood, especially imperatives, are more complex than previously shown. Hitherto mostly blank person/number paradigms are now filled, with alternate forms of probably distinct function also found. Numerous reduplicative templates exist, including apparently an odd vocalic type. Not only lexical suffixes but also lexical circumfixes and prefixes exist. Serial-verb constructions, a fairly novel concept in the Salish literature, are common.},

A brief survey of more recent theoretical advancements with respect to ideologies and contact phenomena follows, paying special attention to studies in linguistic anthropology and variationist sociolinguistics. While recognizing the challenges inherent in the study of linguistic ideologies, this article argues that they should be at the foreground of contact linguistics. To this end, methodological tools for such study are presented, along with theoretical considerations and future directions.},

What the field is yet to offer are reflective accounts of how partnership with communities and participatory research models can begin to decolonise the field. In this paper we reflect on the Indigenous-led fieldwork that allowed us to document Australian Aboriginal English in urban Nyungar country, Southwest Western Australia. We discuss how Indigenous leadership allowed us to choose appropriate data collection methods (the Indigenous cultural form of conversation and storytelling known as `yarning'). Our analysis of premonitory yarns about the death of youth in the community reveals a rich performative style which shows linguistically entrenched ties with traditional Aboriginal Australia, and which provides original material for sociolinguistic analysis. Our work has great potential for social transformation in the inclusion of Indigenous epistemologies, and through `hearing the voices' of speakers rarely featured in sociolinguistic research.},

  abstract = {Prosody has been characterised as a `half-tamed savage' being shaped by both discrete, categorical aspects as well as gradient, continuous phenomena. This book is concerned with the relation of the `wild' and the `tamed' sides of prosodic prominence. It reviews problems that arise from a strict separation of categorical and continuous representations in models of phonetics and phonology, and it explores the potential role of descriptions aimed at reconciling the two domains. In doing so, the book offers an introduction to dynamical systems, a framework that has been studied extensively in the last decades to model speech production and perception. The reported acoustic and articulatory data presented in this book show that categorical and continuous modulations used to enhance prosodic prominence are deeply intertwined and even exhibit a kind of symbiosis. A multi-dimensional dynamical model of prosodic prominence is sketched, based on the empirical data, combining tonal and articulatory aspects of prosodic focus marking. The model demonstrates how categorical and continuous aspects can be integrated in a joint theoretical treatment that overcomes a strict{$<$}br{$>$} separation of phonetics and phonology.},

Moreover, flexibility in data collection, measurement, and analysis (referred to as ``researcher degrees of freedom'') can lead to overconfident beliefs in the robustness of a statistical relationship. One way to systematically decrease publication bias and researcher degrees of freedom is preregistration. A preregistration is a time-stamped document that specifies how data is to be collected, measured, and analyzed prior to data collection. While preregistration is a powerful tool to reduce bias, it comes with certain challenges and limitations which have to be evaluated for each scientific discipline individually. This paper discusses the application, challenges and limitations of preregistration for experimental linguistic research.},

  abstract = {Recent research into grammatical gender from the perspective of information theory has shown how seemingly arbitrary gender systems can ease processing demands by guiding lexical prediction. When the gender of a noun is revealed in a preceding element, the list of possible candidates is reduced to the nouns assigned to that gender. This strategy can be particularly effective if it eliminates words that are likely to compete for activation against the intended word. We propose syntax as the crucial context within which words must be disambiguated, hypothesizing that syntactically similar words should be less likely to share a gender cross-linguistically. We draw on recent work on syntactic information in the lexicon to define the syntactic distribution of a word as a probability vector of its participation in various dependency relations, and we extract such relations for 32 languages from the Universal Dependencies Treebanks. Correlational and mixedeffects regression analyses reveal that syntactically similar nouns are less likely to share a gender, the opposite pattern that is found for semantically and orthographically similar words. We interpret this finding as a design feature of language, and this study adds to a growing body of research attesting to the ways in which functional pressures on learning, memory, production, and perception shape the lexicon in different ways.},

As a consequence, researchers may not know how to properly test them and may potentially run analyses that reliably return the wrong answer to their research question. We discuss three major issues regarding the prediction and interpretation of interactions. First, interactions can be removable in the sense that they appear or disappear depending on scaling decisions, with consequences for a variety of situations (e.g., binary or categorical outcomes, bounded scales with floor and ceiling effects). Second, interactions may be conceptualized as changes in slope or changes in correlations, and because these two phenomena do not necessarily coincide, researchers might draw wrong conclusions. Third, interactions may or may not be causally identified, and this determines which interpretations are valid. Researchers who remain unaware of these distinctions might accidentally analyze their data in a manner that returns the technically correct answer to the wrong question. We illustrate all issues with examples from psychology and issue recommendations for how to best address them in a productive manner.},

After a short review of the general literature on the origins of SVCs and their similarity to converbs (of which Tupi-Guarani gerundives may be considered a subtype), the author gives a detailed account of the Emerillon SVCs. Strong arguments then show that Emerillon serial verbs (superficially comparable to independent verbs) originate from a `deranked' dependent clause. The paper ends with some discussions on clause linkage, comparing more specifically SVCs and converbs on the morphological, syntactic and functional levels.},

The occurrence of boundary pauses in a crosslinguistic corpus of speech suggests that silent pauses are more closely related to both discourse and syntactic planning than filled pauses, but more strongly so for discourse planning. These results were consistent across both first and second language production. However, clause boundary silent pauses in first language speech were more atypical (i.e., longer than average) than those in second language speech. This difference may be due to complexity differences in the first and second language speech samples.},

It analyzes Spanish compound tense auxiliary selection, suggesting that the replacement of ser `be' with haber `have' was affected by (a) the salience of haber + participle in usage contexts previously associated with the use of ser + participle, and (b) the general token frequency of specific verbs and of the ser + participle syntagms that result from these verbs. I argue that it is necessary to take into account both historical processes in order to explain the synchronic gradience in auxiliary selection posited in Sorace's (2000) influential Auxiliary Selection Hierarchy (ASH), as well as propose a sta\- tistical methodology to model these frequency effects in language change. The findings suggest both type and token frequency effects. The former is an actual\- ization process due to the prototypicality of use of ser + participle with telic predicates implying a change of state (e.\hspace{0.166em}g. morir `die'), which are affected by the replacement with haber + participle at a later point in the process of change, whereas the latter is a conservation process evident in ser + participle syntagms formed from highly frequent verbs that, due to their high token frequency, are less affected by the ongoing change. This skewed frequency distribution in the verb population and the resulting conserving effect leads to further changes in auxiliary selection rules.},

We operationalize this question by testing a theory proposed on results regarding a language that did undergo this change, Spanish, on corpus and experimental data. While English FINISH constructions are associated with some of the distributional properties of Early Spanish FINISH, speakers do not show evidence of conventionally associating FINISH constructions with a particular type of inference crucial for the grammaticalization of the Spanish anterior. We propose that the non-conventionality of this inference blocks the grammaticalization of FINISH constructions in English, demonstrating that some of the black box of language change currently attributed to chance can be explored empirically.},

Documentation of the language is scant but recent work has uncovered unpublished materials that might enrich the record. Fieldwork carried out in 2017 established that, in addition to two unconfirmed semi-speakers, there remained only one speaker of Sap\'e; it also expanded on previously-collected materials and gathered additional data.

  author = {Roset, Caroline},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {This thesis provides grammatical details on the phonology, morphology and syntax of the Arabic as it is spoken in Darfur (West Sudan). All three of these linguistic fields give evidence that this variety of Arabic is heavily influenced by the other, particularly Nilo-Saharan languages which are also spoken in the region. For example, the 'typical' Arabic guttural phonemes are omitted or mixed, there are no synchronic gender distinctions, a process towards an invariable pronominal system appears to be at work and Nilo-Saharan word order occurs frequently. As a contact language, Darfur Arabic stands midway between a pidgin or a creole on the one hand, an a full-fledged Arabic colloquial on the other. Moreover, the Arabic of Darfur displays considerable variability and much resembles Chadian Arabic.},

A set of constraints on variables, some universal, some lelgiage-particular, is presented, and the question of what types of syntactic rules they affect is raised. It is shown that these constraints, in conjunction with the notion of command, partition phrase markers into islands -- the maximal domains of applicability of all rules of a specified type.},

The purpose of this paper is to present what is known of their relationships to other Austronesian groups, the Formosan languages to the north and the Malayo-Polynesian languages to the south. It is shown that the Batanic languages are MalayoPolynesian, but do not subgroup with any other smaller group of languages within the huge MalayoPolynesian language group. In view of this, it is possible that the Batanic languages are descended from the speech of a community established in the islands by speakers of Proto Malayo-Polynesian before they reached Luzon. This possibility is supported by the conservatism of the Batanic languages, but remains just that\textemdash a possibility, not a certainty.},

It is thus a language contact phenomenon. In this paper I deconstruct my earlier account of metatypy and show that metatypy is preceded chronologically by lexical and grammatical calquing but is separate from these processes. Thus there are languages which have undergone widespread grammatical calquing but have stopped short of metatypy. The article also examines alternative terms for metatypy and indicates why I believe that the term 'metatypy' is preferable to them and useful for the subdiscipline of contact linguistics. Associated with this is a proposal that contact linguists adopt a strong hypothesis to the effect that bilingual speakers do not copy single constructions from one of their languages to the other on a piecemeal basis but that they always restructure larger systems. This hypothesis is put forward as a basis for research, not as a statement of belief.},

  abstract = {What is pseudocoordination? What are the implications for syntactic theory? This dissertation approaches these questions from the perspective of linguistic typology and syntactic theory. Verbal pseudocoordination like {$<$}em{$>$}go and get{$<$}/em{$>$} or {$<$}em{$>$}try and do{$<$}/em{$>$} is an under-studied phenomenon even in English but especially in languages around the world. In some ways resembling coordination, in others subordination, the mixed properties of these constructions introduce substantive questions for language comparison and theoretical analysis, given the variety of ways in which languages render similar structural relationships and dependencies.{$<$}br{$>$} This dissertation makes three broad contributions to linguistic research. First, the results of a worldwide, balanced sample of 325 languages, as well as smaller samples of creoles and signed languages, provide the distribution and typology of pseudocoordination, serial verb and other multi-verb constructions, supplemented by the appendix listing these features for each language and a comprehensive bibliography; these features are also studied in relation to the cross-linguistic expression of Associated Motion. Second, the unusual morphosyntactic restrictions of the English {$<$}em{$>$}try and{$<$}/em{$>$} construction are documented in detail, along with parallels in Faroese, and shown to require augmented methods for syntactic analysis. Third, the diversity of multi-verb constructions and other theoretically challenging constructions support the proposal of an approach to syntactic theory mixing insights from Generative Grammar and Construction Grammar.

  abstract = {Ross (2009) proposed the Nuclear Austronesian hypothesis, whereby Puyuma, Tsou and Rukai are each single-member first-order subgroups of Austronesian and all other Austronesian languages belong to a Nuclear Austronesian subgroup. The basis of this subgrouping is a complex innovation whereby certain Proto Austronesian nominalizers came also to mark indicative verbs. This paper falls into two parts. The first surveys kinds of evidence that historical linguists use in subgrouping and proposes metrics (\textsection 2) that are then applied to the innovations that support Nuclear Austronesian (\textsection 3) and other recent first-order subgroupings of Austronesian (principally Formosan) languages (\textsection 4). The second part argues that the commonly accepted Tsouic subgroup, which is incompatible with the Nuclear Austronesian hypothesis, is not supported by the evidence. Instead it reflects longterm contact between Tsou on one hand and Kanakanavu and Saaroa on the other (\textsection 5). In conclusion, it is tentatively suggested that the southern part of the Taiwan highlands appears to be the oldest Austronesian homeland area.},

  abstract = {Functional load (FL) quantifies the contributions by phonological contrasts to distinctions made across the lexicon. Previous research has linked particularly low values of FL to sound change. Here, we broaden the scope of enquiry into FL to its evolution at higher values also. We apply phylogenetic methods to examine the diachronic evolution of FL across 90 languages of the Pama\textendash Nyungan (PN) family of Australia. We find a high degree of phylogenetic signal in FL, indicating that FL values covary closely with genealogical structure across the family. Though phylogenetic signals have been reported for phonological structures, such as phonotactics, their detection in measures of phonological function is novel. We also find a significant, negative correlation between the FL of vowel length and of the following consonant\textemdash that is, a time-depth historical trade-off dynamic, which we relate to known allophony in modern PN languages and compensatory sound changes in their past. The findings reveal a historical dynamic, similar to transphonologization, which we characterize as a flow of contrastiveness between subsystems of the phonology. Recurring across a language family that spans a whole continent and many millennia of time depth, our findings provide one of the most compelling examples yet of Sapir's `drift' hypothesis of non-accidental parallel development in historically related languages.},

Time-constrained Visual Encounter Surveys (VES) were conducted for amphibians followed with opportunistic observations during the study period. We compared the species diversity from three land use/land cover types that explained the available habitats and the importance of secondary forest in recolonizing anuran species during the course of study. Interestingly, anuran diversity measured from secondary/abandoned jhum and primary forest areas were found to be relatively equal (Shannon index; H: 2.77 and 2.76). The highest percentage of unique species was recorded from primary forest followed by secondary/abundant jhum and agriculture/settlement areas. However, secondary/abandoned jhum areas provided refuge for most anuran species normally inhabiting primary forest. We found beneficial human interaction along with secondary succession for creating habitat heterogeneity in secondary/abundant forest; and thus supports maximum anuran breeding habitats and species diversity in secondary/abundant jhum areas. Hence, secondary/abundant habitats were also important for anuran habitat conservation along with primary forest. We reported four new distribution records from Arunachal Pradesh: Nanorana chayuensis, Hydrophylax leptoglossa, Odorrana chloronota and Theloderma moloch.},

  abstract = {The paper discusses aspectual distinctions among Polish nominalizations belonging to different semantic domains, in particular action nominals and psych nominals. It is demonstrated that in Polish there are two types of nominals that qualify as complex event nominals in the understanding of Grimshaw 1990: aspectually ambiguous derived nominals whose properties are like those of English derived nominals and verbal nouns which have grammatical aspect and form aspectual pairs like the related verbs. It is argued that not only action nominalizations but also psych nominalizations denote complex eventualities, except that in the former the culmination point terminates the eventuality whereas in the latter it is at the beginning. The perfective/imperfective contrast is taken as evidence for the complexity of the eventuality and the heterogenous nature of the component subevents. In conclusion, it is suggested that the atomic Vendlerian taxonomy of event types is insufficient for the analysis of different types of complex events and furthermore that the overt aspectual distinctions among Polish nominalizations belonging to different semantic domains might be also present covertly in other languages, which leads to ambiguities of various sorts.},

  abstract = {How do children learn to understand and use complex syntactic constructions? In English, Diessel (2004) shows that they do so in two different ways. Complex sentences with dependent clauses (e.g., ``Peter promised that he would come'') develop out of simple sentences that are gradually expanded into multi-clause ones. Complex sentences with coordinate clauses (e.g., ``He tried hard, but he failed'') develop by integrating two independent sentences into a single two-clause unit. Here we expand on that research by focusing on the acquisition of a kind of complex syntactic structure which involves both dependency and coordination\textemdash the clause chain\textemdash in Ku Waru, a Papuan language spoken in the Western Highlands of Papua New Guinea. Clause chains are constructions coordinating multiple clauses in sequence, where the non-final or ``medial'' clauses are in a dependent relationship with the final clause. One function of clause chains, which is often taken to be the prototypical one, is to refer to a series of events in sequence. Some Ku Waru clause chains do refer to sequential events. Other Ku Waru clause chains containing particular verbs refer to single events, sometimes with the particular verb providing aspectual or adverbial qualification (``keep doing,'' ``do quickly,'' etc.). In this article, we track the acquisition of several different kinds of clause chains based on longitudinal recordings of four children acquiring Ku Waru as their first language between the ages of 1{$\frac{1}{2}$} and 5. We show that, although there are differences among the children in the ages at which they acquire the various kinds of clause chain, all four of them follow the same series of steps in doing so. In conclusion, we compare our findings to Diessel's for English. We find that they are similar in some ways and different in others, which may be related to the differences between subordinate constructions, coordinate non-dependent constructions and coordinate-dependent constructions.},

They developed at a time when dictionaries were printed books of finite dimensions \textemdash{} as they have been for almost the whole of their history. In many cases, styles which we take for granted as "natural" features of dictionaries are in reality expedients designed to compress maximum information into the limited space available. A simple example is the kind of "recursive" definition found in many English dictionaries where a nominalization (such as assimilation) is defined in terms of the related verb ("the act of assimilating or state of being assimilated"), and the user is required to make a second look-up (to the base word). Is this an ideal solution, or was it favoured simply as a less space-intensive alternative to a self-sufficient explanation? As dictionaries gradually migrate from print to digital media, space constraints disappear. Some problems simply evaporate. To give a trivial example, the need for abbreviations, tildes and the like no longer exists (though a surprising number of dictionaries maintain these conventions even in their digital versions). So the question arises whether we need to revisit, and re-evaluate, the entire range of editorial policies and conventions in the light of changed circumstances. This paper looks at some familiar editorial and presentational conventions, and considers which are no longer appropriate in the digital medium \textemdash{} and what new policies might replace them.},

We argue that such constructions should be treated syntactically as set-valued grammatical functions in Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG). Sets as values for functions are well-established in LFG and are used in the representation of adjuncts, and also in the representation of coordination. In many Australian languages, coordination is expressed asyndetically, that is, by nominal juxtaposition with no overt coordinator at all. We argue that the syntactic similarity of all juxtaposed constructions (ranging from coordination through a number of more appositional relations) motivates an analysis in which they are treated similarly in the syntax, but suitably distinguished in the semantics. We show how this can be achieved within LFG, providing a unified treatment of the syntax of juxtaposition in Australian languages and showing how the interface to the semantics can be quite straightforwardly defined in the modular LFG approach.},

  abstract = {Uipo, also called Khoibu, is an underdescribed Tibeto-Burman language spoken by around 1800 people in the Chandel district of Manipur. Uipo has four lexical tones: a high falling tone, a low level tone, a low falling tone and a high level tone. These are called Tone 1, Tone 2, Tone 3 and Tone 4 respectively. When tones are combined within one word, there are two different sandhi processes that occur. This article will look at the different contexts where tone sandhi happens, focusing on compounds, possessive constructions, and nominal attribution. For instance, a noun that starts with a Tone 1 or a Tone 2 syllable will get Tone 4 when following a Tone 2 possessive prefix. There are examples of minimal pairs that become homonymic in certain morphological contexts, and these are used to illustrate that the tonal category of a given words has really changed. Interestingly, what otherwise seem like phonological rules have some specific lexical exceptions. For instance, the word to\ng 1kan2 does not change its tone in contexts where it is expected. The sandhi rules are argued to be evidence that Uipo has a four-tone system, as opposed to what has been proposed by some previous accounts of the language which have described it as having only three level tones.},

Despite the importance of the Sino-Tibetan languages, their prehistory remains controversial, with ongoing debate about when and where they originated. To shed light on this debate we develop a database of comparative linguistic data, and apply the linguistic comparative method to identify sound correspondences and establish cognates. We then use phylogenetic methods to infer the relationships among these languages and estimate the age of their origin and homeland. Our findings point to Sino-Tibetan originating with north Chinese millet farmers around 7200 B.P. and suggest a link to the late Cishan and the early Yangshao cultures.},

  abstract = {Typical words in some East Asian languages, including Chinese, have reduced historically from disyllabic (CV{$\cdot$}CV(C)) to monosyllabic (C(C)V(C)) and then open monosyllables (CV). More recently, in some of those languages, many monosyllabic CV forms again appear as disyllabic (CV{$\cdot$}CV). The former developments result from a variety of apparently unconnected segmental changes. In the latter, they often reflect morphological innovations, like compounding and affixation. That is, apparently disparate segmental phonological processes reduced monosyllabic word templates and apparently disparate morphological and phonological processes have created new disyllables, which can all be captured in terms of preferred prosodic templates. We integrate these areal and genetic patterns into a growing literature on prosodic templates in diachrony, expanding the set of languages and patterns. That body of work has focused on sound changes that bring words into alignment with templates while our cases studies also involve clear changes in the templatic structures themselves. Finally, the patterns reviewed here resemble cycles of prosodic change, driven by tensions between reduction and minimal word constraints; we suggest that these phenomena show `bare' prosodic cyclicity without the grammatical or functional ramifications of familiar cycles of change.},

A second subfield has been less concerned with the acousticphonetic properties of speech and more concerned with how words are segmented and recognized. In this subfield, there has been a focus on the nature of communication among different levels of analysis (e.g., phonetic and lexical). In recent years, there has been a growing appreciation of the need to understand how the perceptual system dynamically changes in order to allow listeners to successfully process the variable input and new words that they constantly encounter.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the various functions of the multifunctional case marker -ha in Wutun, a mixed Sinitic language with Northwest Mandarin lexicon and Amdo Tibetan syntax spoken in Tongren County, eastern part of Qinghai Province, Amdo Sprachbund. I will show that the use of -ha is connected to Differential Argument Marking and it is motivated partly by semantic factors and partly by information structure. The case marker -ha often occurs on the Recipient, Patient or Causee argument in clauses with two animate arguments and it can therefore be used to disambiguate arguments. Its use is also connected to affectedness, which can be operationalized in terms of definiteness and saliency. Patient arguments are more likely to be marked with -ha if they are totally affected (e.g. The dog ate the dumplings) than only partially affected (e.g. The dog ate some dumplings). However, the use of -ha cannot be explained solely on the basis of semantic factors and it is often connected to information structure, such as expressing contrastiveness, activating previously mentioned topic or differentiating between topical and focal parts of the sentence. In summary, -ha is used with highly affected non-Agent arguments that often play a special role in information structure.},

Yet many endangered languages lack sufficient data for pretraining such models, or are predominantly oral vernaculars without a standardised writing system, precluding finetuning. Query-by-example spoken term detection (QbE-STD) offers an alternative for iteratively indexing untranscribed speech corpora by locating spoken query terms. Using data from 7 Australian Aboriginal languages and a regional variety of Dutch, all of which are endangered or vulnerable, we show that QbE-STD can be improved by leveraging representations developed for ASR (wav2vec 2.0: the English monolingual model and XLSR53 multilingual model). Surprisingly, the English model outperformed the multilingual model on 4 Australian language datasets, raising questions around how to optimally leverage self-supervised speech representations for QbE-STD. Nevertheless, we find that wav2vec 2.0 representations (either English or XLSR53) offer large improvements (56\textendash 86\% relative) over state-of-the-art approaches on our endangered language datasets.},

One bottleneck is the time-intensive nature of annotation. An even narrower bottleneck occurs for recordings with access constraints, such as language that must be vetted or filtered by authorised community members before annotation can begin. We propose a privacy-preserving workflow to widen both bottlenecks for recordings where speech in the endangered language is intermixed with a more widely-used language such as English for meta-linguistic commentary and questions (e.g. What is the word for `tree'?). We integrate voice activity detection (VAD), spoken language identification (SLI), and automatic speech recognition (ASR) to transcribe the metalinguistic content, which an authorised person can quickly scan to triage recordings that can be annotated by people with lower levels of access. We report workin-progress processing 136 hours archival audio containing a mix of English and Muruwari. Our collaborative work with the Muruwari custodian of the archival materials show that this workflow reduces metalanguage transcription time by 20\% even given only minimal amounts of annotated training data: 10 utterances per language for SLI and 39 minutes of the English for ASR.},

This study uses static palatography to determine the articulatory positions of four coronal consonants and acoustic analysis to describe some characteristics of certain salient sounds in Kalanguya. Some remarkable findings of this study are as follows: (a) the places of articulation of coronal consonants /t/, /d/, /l/ and /n/ are at dental and alveolar regions. (b) The glottal consonant /h/ can be considered as a ``true fricative'' and compensates for the lack of /s/ in Kalanguya. (c) The voiced bilabial stop /b/ is labialized [bw]. (d) The voiceless plosive /k/ in Kalanguya is uvular [q], which is quite rare in Austronesian languages. (e) Finally, there are four vowel sounds in Kalanguya: one front vowel [], two central [a] and [], and one back vowel []. Moreover, Kalanguya vowel inventory has no internal symmetry in terms of F1 and F2 measurements and gender differences and syllable stress have no effects on vowel height and frontness.},

Before taking a surprise recognition task, Spanish and Mandarin speakers (who lexicalise culmination in different verb predicate forms) watched short videos of events, either in a non-verbal (probe-recognition) or a verbal experiment (event description). Results show that culminated events (i.e. ceased change-of-state events) were remembered best across experiments. Language use showed to enhance memory overall. Further, the form of the verb predicates used for denoting culmination had a moderate effect on memory.},

Their tense systems have multiple subdivisions within past and future tenses. Tense is fused with number, but the number system varies depending on tense, with the most number values distinguished in the future tenses. Immediate and delayed imperatives are distinguished, with the immediate imperative implying brusqueness and the delayed imperative implying politeness. Aspect is generally encoded analytically, with auxiliary verb constructions, although some languages mark habitual aspect through a verbal suffix. Surprisingly, medial verbs may mark more aspectual distinctions than final verbs. Finally, although grammatical evidentiality is not widely known to exist in Papuan languages of northeastern New Guinea, non-firsthand evidentiality is found to be entwined with verbal aspect marking in both Awara and Nungon. The four Finisterre-Huon (FH) Papuan languages represented in this volume \textendash{} Awara, Ma Manda, Nek, and Nungon \textendash{} bring to light many of the unique typological characteristics of this group of under-\- described languages.1 The papers presented here offer a sense of the commonalities and differences found in the verbal inflectional systems of FH languages.

None of the conventionalized ways humans imitate birdsong has yet been studied rigorously, least of all warblish, for which a term has not even existed. Combing the ethno-ornithological literature for instances of warblish shows patterns in its functions and semantics across cultures, which range from friendly messages to ribald mocking. Warblish may evoke perceived ties between bird calls and other natural phenomena and can even offer clues to historical contact between human communities. Investigation of methods of birdsong imitation may expose alternative folk taxonomies based on vocalization type rather than morphology. As artifacts of human creativity in response to nature, warblish and the other methods of birdsong imitation described here merit interdisciplinary inquiry.},

In a clause chain, as many as 20 or more `medial' clauses with underspecified verbal predicates combine with a single `final' clause with fully-specified verbal predicate. Clause chains are of interest for three main reasons: (a) the special syntactic relationship between clauses, which is neither textbook subordination nor coordination; (b) the potential extreme length of a single chain; and (c) switch-reference marking in clause chains of some languages could require speakers to plan at least one clause ahead as they speak. Research on child production of complex sentences has largely overlooked clause chains. Longitudinal data for three children aged 1;1 to 3;3 acquiring the Papuan language Nungon show that Nungon-speaking children begin producing clause chains around the age of 2;4, with a marked increase in rate of use around age 2;11. Chain length is limited to two clauses until age 3;1. Different-subject marking in medial clauses is used by all three children early, but is first attested in one-clause, `root medial' contexts, rather than in chains. Bayesian statistical models confirm the strong tendency for children to use root medials in expressions of desires and commands. Children's production of three types of complex sentences\textemdash clause chains, subordinated final clauses, and coordinated final clauses\textemdash is shown to be subject to the same type of developmental constraint; but once development reaches an adequate level for increased complex sentence production, children acquiring Nungon produce many more clause chains than complex sentences involving subordinated or coordinated final clauses.},

  abstract = {Studies of the acquisition of verbs tend to focus on one-verb predicates of the prevalent English type. But in hundreds of languages around the world, multi-verb predicates like serial verb constructions are widely used. It could be reasoned that children should begin producing simple, single-verb predicates before they are able to produce multi-verb predicates. But alternatively, many multi-verb predicates are idiomatic and could, as chunks, lend themselves to holophrastic acquisition by small children. This article examines early productions of multi-verb predicates in the speech of three children (aged 1;1\textendash 2;4, 2;1\textendash 3;3, and 2;10\textendash 3;3) acquiring the Papuan language Nungon, comparing patterns there with productions in the child-directed speech of their parents, and with the children's productions of simple, one-verb predicates. The study's youngest child never produces multi-verb predicates in the study period, but the child studied for the widest age range produces them from age 2;4, when she has still not acquired productive use of all verbal inflections, and both older children show proportionally increasing trends in multi-verb predicate use. Semantically, the earliest multi-verb predicates can be analyzed as describing multidimensional unitary events, with this expanding to events that can be divided into multiple distinct components at later ages. Delays in production of certain other multi-verb predicate types that are robustly present in parental input at all ages cannot be linked to a single factor, but likely relate to a combination of increased phonological or morphological complexity and increased conceptual difficulty.},

The first root nonfinite form is an apparent innovation of the child, unacceptable in adult-to-adult speech, which must be learned from a special auxiliary construction in child-directed speech. The second root non-finite form functions like attested adult main clause use of the same form. During the study period, the first root non-finite form increases sharply to function as a default verb form, then decreases to nil by 3;2. The second increases gradually to near-adult levels. Both forms are non-finite and have similar proportions in the input. Thus, factors other than finiteness and frequency must explain their distributions.},

  abstract = {Clause chains are a special type of complex sentence, found in hundreds of languages outside Western Europe, in which clauses are dependent but not embedded, and dozens of clauses can be combined into a single sentential unit. Unlike English complex sentences, clause chains' distribution is partially predictable in that they can, most fundamentally, be linked to a particular semantic context: description of temporally sequential events or actions. This and the morphological simplicity of verb forms in clause chains may combine to accelerate their acquisition by children, relative to complex sentences in other languages. No previous cross-linguistic studies of the acquisition of complex sentences have investigated clause chaining. In this paper, we report insights from a survey of the acquisition of clause chaining in six languages of diverse stocks with child speech databases spanning 1;1 to 10 years. Overall, children acquiring clause chaining languages begin to produce 2-clause chains between around 1;11 and 2;6. An initial stage in which chains are limited to just two clauses in length is followed by a stage in which longer chains of 3\textendash 5 clauses are also produced. Children acquiring languages in which adults produce both same-subject and different-subject clause chains produce a similar mix from early on; for some languages, this involves morphological ``switch-reference'' marking that anticipates the identity of the subject of an upcoming clause. This survey broadens our understanding of the acquisition of complex sentences by adding new data on the acquisition timing, semantics, and reference continuity of early clause chains.},

  abstract = {Hundreds of languages worldwide use a sentence structure known as the ``clause chain,'' in which 20 or more clauses can be stacked to form a sentence. The Papuan language Nungon is among a subset of clause chaining languages that require ``switch-reference'' suffixes on nonfinal verbs in chains. These suffixes announce whether the subject of each upcoming clause will differ from the subject of the previous clause. We examine two major issues in psycholinguistics: predictive processing in comprehension, and advance planning in production. Whereas previous work on other languages has demonstrated that sentence planning can be incremental, switch-reference marking would seem to prohibit strictly incremental planning, as it requires speakers to plan the next clause before they can finish producing the current one. This suggests an intriguing possibility: planning strategies may be fundamentally different in Nungon. We used a mobile eye-tracker and solar-powered laptops in a remote village in Papua, New Guinea, to track Nungon speakers' gaze in two experiments: comprehension and production. Curiously, during comprehension, fixation data failed to find evidence that switch-reference marking is used for predictive processing. However, during production, we found evidence for advance planning of switch-reference markers, and, by extension, the subjects they presage. We propose that this degree of advance syntactic planning pushes the boundaries of what is known about sentence planning, drawing on data from a novel morpheme type in an understudied language.},

  abstract = {Kove, an Oceanic language of Papua New Guinea, has independent (free) personal and some dependent (bound) pronominal forms, namely subject markers, object suffixes, and possessive affixes. The pronominal system encodes three personal distinctions: first person, second person, and third person. There is also a distinction between inclusive and exclusive. While Kove generally marks two numbers, singular and plural, independent pronouns have two more number categories. One is the dual and the other is the so-called ``collective.'' The collective refers to a group that consists of members of different families. In contrast, the plural usually refers to a group of people from a single family. While I recognize the dual and the collective in Kove's pronominal system, I separate them from the singular and plural pronouns based on their syntactic behavior, which differs from that of the singular and plural pronouns in three main ways. First, the dual and the collective pronouns can co-occur with object suffixes. Second, they can function as inclusory pronouns. Third, the collective pronoun can occur with the independent plural pronouns.},

Post Pandit, sociolinguistics in India took a major applied turn which lasted for nearly three decades. Beginning 2000 saw a variationist wave in sociolinguistics in India which has got stronger over the years. The paper analyses the factors that were responsible for the various turns that Sociolinguistics took over time.},

It has been claimed that intonation does not facilitate recall over and above the effect achieved by pauses. This may be related to the fact that past research has used synthesized intonation contours. In this replication study, we show that intonation does provide benefits once more naturalistic intonation contours are used. This benefit is independent of response modality (spoken responses, keyboard responses, or handwritten responses in a grid). We furthermore show that intonation differentially affects specific positions within the sequence of digits. Crucially, our results suggest that researchers and clinicians need to pay attention to intonation when assessing working memory using spoken language.},

This research indicates that this speaker's Chinese intonation patterns do not display the pitch register distinction posited for Beijing Mandarin. However, she does use both pitch range expansion and high boundary tones as methods for distinguishing statements from questions. Her English intonation system displays a much denser assignment of tonal targets than that of a native speaker of English. She demonstrates a potential knowledge of pitch accent for words spoken in isolation, but she continues to apply the same tonal pattern to individual words even in the context of a larger utterance, thus using a system that more closely represents lexical tone. However, she demonstrates knowledge of English boundary tones. Thus, this research provides evidence for the way in which specific aspects of one's native language may be systematically applied to a very different system.},

I show that whilst having a strongly semantic base involving animacy, gender in Aru languages is a grammatical category in which many nouns denoting certain types of entities that lack discernable biological animacy are assigned to the same gender as that of animate referents. I conclude by considering the system of gender in proto-Aru.},

  abstract = {Using a sample of 116 languages, this article investigates the typology of comparative constructions and their distribution in Melanesia, one of the world's least-understood linguistic areas. We present a rigorous definition of a comparative construction as a ``comparative concept'', thereby excluding many constructions which have been considered functionally comparatives in Melanesia. Conjoined comparatives are shown to dominate at the core of the area on the island of New Guinea, while (monoclausal) exceed comparatives are found in the maritime regions around New Guinea. Outside of Melanesia adpositional and other comparative constructions including particle comparatives are most frequent in Austronesian languages. The unity of the conjoined comparative type in the core Melanesian area illustrates that, while morpho-syntactic profiles of Melanesian languages are heterogenous, significant convergence in the ``ways of saying things'' can be found across the region. Additionally, we find no cases of clause chaining constructions being used for encoding comparatives, even in canonical clause chaining languages of central New Guinea. Our findings thus offer no support for Stassen's claim of a correlation between temporal chaining type and comparative construction type. Instead we suggest that an areal preference for mini-clauses may explain the dominance of the conjoined comparative in Melanesia.},

This feature of Papuan and Australian languages has not yet been considered as a part of a single phenomenon, nor examined in any detail. This paper presents the first in-depth survey of lexical expressions encoding the concepts `tree', `firewood' and `fire'. Looking at 300 languages of Sahul, we plot the frequency and geographical distribution of colexification patterns for the three concepts in individual languages. We include analysis of the relationships between simple and complex terms for these concepts, which further elucidates geographic and genetic patterns of colexification and differentiation. Overall, we find that the most common pattern in the region is to colexify `firewood' and `fire', but not `tree', contra earlier claims. Nevertheless, patterns present in Sahul are rare worldwide, indicating that Sahul is a large diffusion area worthy of further investigation in linguistic studies by Papuanists and Australianists collectively.},

In this paper, we test the prediction that `stress-timed' languages are characterized by a dominance of the prosodic word against a typological sample of 58 languages. Although there is a slight cross-linguistic tendency in favor of the prediction, there is no statistical support for the proposed correlation. Since counterexamples include not only individual languages but also entire language families, we advocate a different view on prosodic word domain structure. The prosodic word profile of a given language is more reliably predicted by the family membership of that language than by universal correlations concerning its rhythm class membership. We substantiate this claim by a survey of MonKhmer's family signature on prosodic word domain structure in Mon, where sound patterns target either the monosyllabic stem or the maximally inflected disyllabic word.},

  abstract = {Human societies are collective brains. People within every society have cultural brains\textemdash brains that have evolved to selectively seek out adaptive knowledge and socially transmit solutions. Innovations emerge at a population level through the transmission of serendipitous mistakes, incremental improvements and novel recombinations. The rate of innovation through these mechanisms is a function of (1) a society's size and interconnectedness (sociality), which affects the number of models available for learning; (2) fidelity of information transmission, which affects how much information is lost during social learning; and (3) cultural trait diversity, which affects the range of possible solutions available for recombination. In general, and perhaps surprisingly, all three levers can increase and harm innovation by creating challenges around coordination, conformity and communication. Here, we focus on the `paradox of diversity'\textemdash that cultural trait diversity offers the largest potential for empowering innovation, but also poses difficult challenges at both an organizational and societal level. We introduce `cultural evolvability' as a framework for tackling these challenges, with implications for entrepreneurship, polarization and a nuanced understanding of the effects of diversity. This framework can guide researchers and practitioners in how to reap the benefits of diversity by reducing costs.

  abstract = {One of the most basic assumptions regarding language comprehension is that it proceeds incrementally, i.e. by seeking to maximise the degree of interpretation computed with each new word that is encountered. This perspective has often been though to entail that the thematic interpretation of an argument may be derived from its grammatical function, for example, via a preference-strategy associating a subject with a Causer. In the present paper, we argue that these conclusions are not supported by experimental findings. Rather, as we show on the basis of a number of studies using eventrelated brain potentials (ERPs), the degree of meaning derived from a given sentence fragment (form) during online sentence comprehension differs as a function of the morphological informativeness of the sentential arguments. Finally, we present a new model of sentence comprehension, the Argument Dependency Model (ADM), which is designed to capture these differences in the way that meaning is computed incrementally. Specifically, the ADM assumes that argument processing proceeds via two alternative processing pathways, one of which is syntactic, and the other of which is thematic (interpretive) in nature. Whereas both pathways seek to establish hierarchical relations between arguments, only the thematic pathway allows for incremental interpretation to be maximised. Which of the two pathways is chosen during the comprehension of a given sentence crucially depends on the morphological informativeness (i.e. presence or absence of unambiguous morphological case marking) of the arguments. Consequences for language architecture arising from this model will be discussed. \# 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, an increasingly popular line of argumentation holds that many,{$<$}br{$>$} perhaps most, typological regularities are long-term reflections of their diachronic sources, rather than being `target-driven' by overarching functional-adaptive motivations.{$<$}br{$>$} On this view, recurrent pathways of reanalysis and grammaticalization can lead to uniform synchronic results, obviating the need to postulate global forces like ambiguity{$<$}br{$>$} avoidance, processing efficiency or iconicity, especially if there is no evidence for such{$<$}br{$>$} motivations in the genesis of the respective constructions. On the other hand, the recent{$<$}br{$>$} typological literature is equally ripe with talk of `complex adaptive systems', `attractor{$<$}br{$>$} states' and `cross-linguistic convergence'. One may wonder, therefore, how much room{$<$}br{$>$} is left for traditional functional-adaptive forces and how exactly they influence the diachronic trajectories that shape universal distributions. The papers in the present volume{$<$}br{$>$} are intended to provide an accessible introduction to this debate. Covering theoretical,{$<$}br{$>$} methodological and empirical facets of the issue at hand, they represent current ways{$<$}br{$>$} of thinking about the role of diachronic sources in explaining grammatical universals,{$<$}br{$>$} articulated by seasoned and budding linguists alike.},

It concludes that a large vocabulary is necessary to function in English: 8000\textendash 9000 word families for reading, and perhaps as many as 5000\textendash 7000 families for oral discourse. In addition, a number of word knowledge aspects need to be learned about each lexical item. Taken together, this amounts to a substantial lexical learning challenge, one which many/most learners fail to meet. To facilitate adequate vocabulary learning, four vocabulary learning partners (students, teachers, materials writers, and researchers) need to contribute to the learning process. Vocabulary learning programs need to include both an explicit, intentional learning component and a component based around maximizing exposure and incidental learning. The four learning strands (meaning-focused input, meaning-focused output, languagefocused learning, and fluency development) suggested by Nation (2001) provide a structure by which to integrate intentional and incidental vocabulary learning. The overriding principle for maximizing vocabulary learning is to increase the amount of engagement learners have with lexical items. All four learning partners need to acknowledge the incremental nature of vocabulary learning, and to develop learning programs which are principled, long-term, and which recognize the richness and scope of the lexical knowledge that needs to be mastered.},

Most recently, durational differences between different types of /s/ have been found to also hold for pseudowords: the duration of /s/ is longest in non-morphemic contexts, shorter with suffixes, and shortest in clitics. At the theoretical level such systematic differences are unexpected and unaccounted for in current theories of speech production. Following a recent approach, we implemented a linear discriminative learning network trained on real word data in order to predict the duration of word-final non-morphemic and plural /s/ in pseudowords using production data by a previous production study. It is demonstrated that the duration of word-final /s/ in pseudowords can be predicted by LDL networks trained on real word data. That is, duration of word-final /s/ in pseudowords can be predicted based on their relations to the lexicon.},

Previous studies have shown that structural factors such as constituent boundaries influence hesitation placement. This study accounts for hesitation placement from a usage-based perspective through the analysis of hesitations in prepositional phrase contexts in the Switchboard NXT corpus of American English. Using this method, I demonstrate that oft-used sequences are less likely to be interrupted by hesitations than low frequency word pairs. Fur\- thermore, results show that complex measures of the associations between words cannot only predict hesitation behavior, but also model semantic unity. These results strongly point to frequency effects in speech processing. Co-occurrence patterns of words are mentally tracked so that with increasing frequency or likelihood of co-occurrence words become easier to retrieve as a sequence.},

Its aim is to assess whether such semantic shifts may lead to further semantic and syntactic differentiation between the verb senses and whether they can be described as shifts away or towards prototypical transitivity (cf.

In a corpus-based analysis, it utilises CART trees and a random forest to determine which syntactic and semantic properties differentiate literal and metaphorical uses of derail. Results reveal a syntactic shift from transitive to intransitive in the older literal construction which hardly affects the younger metaphorical one. This indicates that differentiation can be an epiphenomenon of semantic shifts.},

In this paper we probe these assumptions against discourse data from nine languages. We find little evidence for specialized syntactic configurations accommodating new referents; the only notable exception is the association of new reference with direct objects, suggests that linking new referents to already established discourse frames through a transitive construction is preferable to isolating them in an intransitive one. Where specific intransitive predicates are indeed found to host new referents, we find this to be motivated primarily by semantic considerations. Contrary to long-held assumptions, we conclude that the cognitive challenge of referent introduction is only weakly reflected in morphosyntax; instead, discourse production is most efficient when new referents are integrated seamlessly with content-driven demands of the narration.},

From a usage-based perspective, investigations of variation and preferences of use are at the core of understanding the distribution of conventionalized structures and their diachronic development across languages. Specific findings of corpus-based typological studies pertain to universals of text production, for example, in prosodic partitioning; to cognitive biases constraining diverse patterns of use, for example, in constituent order; and to correlations of diverse patterns of use with language-specific structures and conventions. We also consider remaining challenges for corpus-based typology, in particular the development of crosslinguistically more representative corpora that include spoken (or signed) texts, and its vast potential in the future.},

Zusammen gegen Corona", which was issued by the German government to enlist support for the measures taken to contain Covid 19. The first part of the paper provides an overview of the theory of mental spaces and the blending theory (Fauconnier 1994, Fauconnier \& Turner 2002), which belong to the research field of cognitive linguistics. In the second, analytical part of the paper, the theoretical considerations are transferred to the aforementioned video clip. It is demonstrated how mental spaces are constructed and connected with each other to construe the fictionalized discourse situation that is displayed in the video. The approach of blending theory is further used to explain how emergent, creative meaning is generated in the video clip. For that purpose, three examples of blending processes in the video clip are examined. It is first shown that the fictionalization of the narrative hinges on the resolution of incongruences between the spectator's Reality Space and a fictional future space through a cognitive blending process. I further discuss two examples of multimodal blending processes in which incoherent visual and linguistic input of the video is restructured and given a new meaning in the blend. The analysis reveals that blending processes are indeed fundamental to unlocking the message of the video clip.},

However, the units differed in scope, with many more auditory units occurring than acoustic units. This result suggests that the common practice of assuming the `intonational phrase' to be the primary domain of prosodic phenomena such as declination does not adequately account for our data of larger periods of speech. Both acoustic and auditory analysis are needed for a satisfactory description of intonation. The establishment of a methodological connecting link between the acoustic and auditory dimensions suggests that further comparisons of such different data types may yield guidelines for regularizing the relationship between the two levels.},

Constructions, in this approach, are defined as complex, schematic signs which are non-compositional, i.e. which have to be learned in a way which is similar to lexical items. In principle, the construction-based model is well suited to language description, since constructions which are specific to a language can be dealt with in the same framework as constructions which are common cross-linguistically. Yet, identifying a construction and distinguishing it from a compositional combination of signs, or from a formally and functionally related construction, is not always a straightforward task in descriptive practice. This is particularly true for spoken language, where the interaction of prosody and grammar has to be taken into account. I will propose here that gestalt-based constructions or G-Constructions, for which coherence is ensured by contiguity and prosodic means, should be distinguished from R-Constructions, where a relational element is responsible for the coherence of the construction, and which may therefore be distributed among two (or more) intonation units. These issues are illustrated by applying a construction-based description to various multi-predicate expressions in the Australian language Jaminjung.},

While there exists increasing evidence that discontinuous NPs are associated with specific information structure constellations crosslinguistically, Australian languages continue to be presented in the literature as radically non-configurational, with unlimited freedom of word order. We argue for Jaminjung, an Australian language of the Mirndi family, that once true NP discontinuity is carefully distinguished from other, superficially similar constructions, it is infact highly constrained and can be described in terms of very specific information structure categories. The first of these, contrastive argumentfocus on an NP containing a given element, is widely attested crosslinguistically. The second, sentence focus, has only rarely been associated with noun phrase discontinuity in the literature. We show that the two types can be distinguished on prosodie grounds. Our account of both types challenges some previous analyses which rely on different information structure values for the parts of the discontinuous NF. The findings underscore the importance of taking into account prosodie information and discourse context in the syntactic analysis of spoken language.},

This article focuses on language-specific classifications of signs into word classes in two different sign languages: German Sign Language and Kata Kolok, the sign language of a village community in Bali.             The article discusses semantic and structural criteria for identifying word classes in the target sign languages. On the basis of a data set of signs, these criteria are systematically tested out as a first step towards an inductive classification of signs. Approaches and analyses relating to the problem of word classes in linguistic typology are used for shedding new light on the issue of word class distinctions in sign languages.},

As far as we know, much of these have not been done before. As such, we are hoping that the comprehensive coverage of key topics in all these essential areas in our handbook will benefit researchers and students not just from psychology and linguistics, but also readers from all other related fields of cognitive sciences to draw insights and inspirations from the chapters herein.},

  abstract = {A series of rapid appraisal surveys were conducted during 2007 at various locations in Papua, Indonesia as a means of providing an overview of some key linguistic and sociolinguistic features of the regional Malay variety/varieties (denoted herein as Papuan Malay) spoken on or near the coastal regions of Papua. To accomplish the survey, native speakers of Papuan Malay (PM) conducted informal group interviews regarding sociolinguistic features of PM via focus groups held in both urban and rural locations in each of five major kabupatens in the coastal region (Jayapura, Sorong, FakFak, Merauke, Mimika). All group interview participants were asked to complete an individual questionnaire regarding personal language use and family language use history. In addition, recorded texts and targeted elicitations were collected from a sub-group of the group interview participants. Finally, choice of language used and speaker/listener demographics were recorded for conversations observed (N = 989) in a variety of domains. Background research indicates that PM is likely historically derived from other eastern regional Malays (e.g., Ambonese Malay, North Moluccan Malay, etc.) which have their roots in a bazaar Malay used as a trade language. Sociolinguistically, PM vitality was observed to be strong and its use widespread. Shift from use of vernacular languages to PM appears to have been strong over the last couple of generations, particularly for those raised in Papua's urban centers. Papuan Malay is used in all domains except in some formal situations in both the educational (e.g., delivering formal instruction) and religious (e.g., preaching, leading corporate prayer) domains. Language attitudes towards PM are quite positive among indigenous Papuans and desire for the development of written materials in PM was expressed. Linguistically, preliminary analysis of the data corroborates previous conclusions in the literature that PM exhibits some key differences with standard Indonesian in the areas of phonology, syntax, morphology, and lexicon. Discourse features were also observed to differ. In conculsion, we believe there is strong justification for the establishment of an official language development program in Papuan Malay.},

  abstract = {By force of nature, every bit of spoken language is produced at a particular speed. However, this speed is not constant\textemdash speakers regularly speed up and slow down. Variation in speech rate is influenced by a complex combination of factors, including the frequency and predictability of words, their information status, and their position within an utterance. Here, we use speech rate as an index of word-planning effort and focus on the time window during which speakers prepare the production of words from the two major lexical classes, nouns and verbs. We show that, when naturalistic speech is sampled from languages all over the world, there is a robust cross-linguistic tendency for slower speech before nouns compared with verbs, both in terms of slower articulation and more pauses. We attribute this slowdown effect to the increased amount of planning that nouns require compared with verbs. Unlike verbs, nouns can typically only be used when they represent new or unexpected information; otherwise, they have to be replaced by pronouns or be omitted. These conditions on noun use appear to outweigh potential advantages stemming from differences in internal complexity between nouns and verbs. Our findings suggest that, beneath the staggering diversity of grammatical structures and cultural settings, there are robust universals of language processing that are intimately tied to how speakers manage referential information when they communicate with one another.},

This paper provides a systematic cross-linguistic comparison of relative durations of final and penultimate words in utterances in terms of the degree to which such words are lengthened. The study uses time-aligned corpora from 10 genealogically, areally, and culturally diverse languages, including eight small, under-resourced, and mostly endangered languages, as well as English and Dutch. Clear effects of lengthening words at the end of utterances are found in all 10 languages, but the degrees of lengthening vary. Languages also differ in the relative durations of words that precede utterance-final words. In languages with on average short words in terms of number of segments, these penultimate words are also lengthened. This suggests that lengthening extends backwards beyond the final word in these languages, but not in languages with on average longer words. Such typological patterns highlight the importance of examining prosodic phenomena in diverse language samples beyond the small set of majority languages most commonly investigated so far.},

Through a study of social organization, it shows how a major ritual, pengosang, has been utilized by an ethnic fraction of the Aoheng as a political tool to counterbalance the formal political prominence achieved by another ethnic fraction through social stratification and maintain control of all aspects of the village's political life, in domestic affairs as well as in foreign relations.},

The underlying problems inherent in the definition of this  notion are here identified, and a possible solution is  suggested. This amounts to separating more clearly the  notions of TCU and Transition Relevance Place (TRP). In  this view, the TCU is defined as the smallest interactionally  relevant complete linguistic unit, in a given context,  that is constructed with syntactic and prosodic resources  within their semantic, pragmatic, activity-type-specific,  and sequential conversational context. It ends in a TRP  unless particular linguistic and interactional resources  are used to project and postpone the TRP to the end of  a larger multi-unit turn. This suggestion tries to spell  out some of the assumptions that the seminal work in CA  made in principle, but never formulated explicitly.},

The paper presents the methodology used for data elicitation and the results for Kilivila. Kilivila can express ENTER and EXIT concepts either with specific lexicalized verbal expressions, or with constructions that use the motion verbs 'come' and/or 'go' together with a locative like 'in, into' or 'out, outside' (these constructions can be compared to Talmy's "verb+satellite constructions"), or with serial verb constructions that minutely describe the ENTER/EXIT actions observed. Both the form and the semantics of these constructions are discussed.},

Does one description yield smoothly into the next one such that different models lie naturally along a hierarchy containing each other? Or, instead, are there sharp transitions between one description and the next, such that to gain a little bit accuracy it is necessary to change our framework radically? Do different levels describe the same linguistic aspects with increasing (or decreasing) accuracy? Historically, answers to these questions were guided by intuition and resulted in subfields of study, from phonetics to syntax and semantics. Need for research at each level is acknowledged, but seldom are these different aspects brought together (with notable exceptions). Here, we propose a methodology to inspect empirical corpora systematically, and to extract from them, blindly, relevant phenomenological scales and interactions between them. Our methodology is rigorously grounded in information theory, multi-objective optimization, and statistical physics. Salient levels of linguistic description are readily interpretable in terms of energies, entropies, phase transitions, or criticality. Our results suggest a critical point in the description of human language, indicating that several complementary models are simultaneously necessary (and unavoidable) to describe it.},

The lower frequency correlates with the length of coding: antipassives tend to be coded with longer forms than basic transitive verbs. Thirdly, we explore frequency associations of different lexical input types and find that it is the rare input types that tend to select the antipassive, if the marking is differential, while the frequent ones correlate with the unmarked verb (A-lability). We, furthermore, show that the rarer argument types and argument scenarios correlate stronger with antipassives than the more frequent argument types and scenarios.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Efficiency is central to understanding the communicative and cognitive underpinnings of language. However, efficiency management is a complex mechanism in which different efficiency effects\textemdash such as articulatory, processing and planning ease, mental accessibility, and informativity, online and offline efficiency effects\textemdash conspire to yield the coding of linguistic signs. While we do not yet exactly understand the interactional mechanism of these different effects, we argue that universal attractors are an important component of any dynamic theory of efficiency that would be aimed at predicting efficiency effects across languages. Attractors are defined as universal states around which language evolution revolves. Methodologically, we approach efficiency from a cross-linguistic perspective on the basis of a world-wide sample of 383 languages from 53 families, balancing all six macro-areas (Eurasia, North and South America, Australia, Africa, and Oceania). We explore the grammatical domain of verbal person\textendash number subject indexes. We claim that there is an attractor state in this domain to which languages tend to develop and tend not to leave if they happen to comply with the attractor in their earlier stages of evolution. The attractor is characterized by different lengths for each person and number combination, structured along Zipf's predictions. Moreover, the attractor strongly prefers non-compositional, cumulative coding of person and number. On the basis of these and other properties of the attractor, we conclude that there are two domains in which efficiency pressures are most powerful: strive towards less processing and articulatory effort. The latter, however, is overridden by constant information flow. Strive towards lower lexicon complexity and memory costs are weaker efficiency pressures for this grammatical category due to its order of frequency.},

It dispenses with functional or cognitive explanations of these because harmonic orders may simply be explained as one order emerging from the other and thus as historical accidents. We provide twofold evidence against this approach and show that (i) universally preferred structures may emerge without any preconditions in the grammaticalization source and (ii) that universally dispreferred structures of the source disappear in the course of time. First, we demonstrate that the development of the three harmonic, head-first word orders (VO, AdpN, NGen) in Postclassical Greek can hardly be considered a historical coincidence, because they match chronologically and, at the same time, are entirely unrelated etymologically, and because neither of these had a bias for ordering heads before dependents in the source. The emergence of the three harmonic word orders is extremely improbable under the null hypothesis of a development by chance (odds 0.037). Secondly, we provide evidence for the reverse case: cross-linguistically dispreferred properties inherited from the source are abandoned in the course of the development.},

Because representation influences production regardless of context, production should be biased by how often each word has been reduced in the speaker's prior experience. This study investigates whether speakers have a context-independent bias to reduce low-informativity words, which are usually predictable and therefore usually reduced. Content word durations were extracted from the Buckeye and Switchboard speech corpora, and analyzed for probabilistic reduction effects using a language model based on spontaneous speech in the Fisher corpus. The analysis supported the hypothesis: low-informativity words have shorter durations, even when the effects of local contextual predictability, frequency, speech rate, and several other variables are controlled for. Additional models that compared word types against only other words of the same segmental length further supported this conclusion. Words that usually appear in predictable contexts are reduced in all contexts, even those in which they are unpredictable. The result supports representational models in which reduction is stored, and where sufficiently frequent reduction biases later production. The finding provides new evidence that probabilistic reduction interacts with lexical representation.},

For example, the realisation of the inflected word frees should be influenced by the phonological plan for free, and thus be non-homophonous with the morphologically-simple word freeze. We test this prediction by analysing productions of forty such inflected/simple word pairs, embedded in pseudo-conversational speech structured to avoid metalinguistic task effects, and balanced for frequency, orthography, as well as segmental and prosodic context. We find that stem and suffix durations are significantly longer by about 4\textendash 7\% in fricative-final inflected words (frees, laps) compared to their simple counterparts (freeze, lapse), while we find a null effect for stop-final words. The result suggests that wordforms influence production of their relatives.},

They reported that some language regions (in the anterior temporal cortex and near the temporo-parietal junction) were sensitive to constituent length only for sequences of real words but not pseudowords. In contrast, language regions in the inferior frontal and posterior temporal cortex showed the same pattern of increased response to longer constituents\textemdash and similar overall response magnitudes\textemdash for word and pseudoword sequences. Based on these results, Pallier et al. argued that the latter regions represent abstract sentence structure. Here we identify methodological and theoretical concerns with the Pallier et al. study and conduct a replication across two fMRI experiments. Our results do not support Pallier et al.'s critical claim of distinct neural specialization for abstract syntactic representations. Instead, we find that all language regions show a similar profile of sensitivity to both constituent length and lexicality (stronger responses to real-word than pseudoword stimuli). In addition, we argue that the constituent length effect in these experiments i) is not readily grounded in established theories of sentence processing, and ii) may not actually derive from syntactic structure building, but may instead reflect the temporal receptive window of the human language system.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        A standard view of human language processing is that comprehenders build richly structured mental representations of natural language utterances, word by word, using computationally costly memory operations supported by domain-general working memory resources. However, three core claims of this view have been questioned, with some prior work arguing that (1) rich word-by-word structure building is not a core function of the language comprehension system, (2) apparent working memory costs are underlyingly driven by word predictability (             surprisal             ), and/or (3) language comprehension relies primarily on domain-general rather than domain-specific working memory resources. In this work, we simultaneously evaluate all three of these claims using naturalistic comprehension in fMRI. In each participant, we functionally localize (a) a language-selective network and (b) a `multiple-demand' network that supports working memory across domains, and we analyze the responses in these two networks of interest during naturalistic story listening with respect to a range of theory-driven predictors of working memory demand under rigorous surprisal controls. Results show robust surprisal-independent effects of word-by-word memory demand in the language network and no effect of working memory demand in the multiple demand network. Our findings thus support the view that language comprehension (1) entails word-by-word structure building using (2) computationally intensive memory operations that are not explained by surprisal. However, these results challenge (3) the domain-generality of the resources that support these operations, instead indicating that working memory operations for language comprehension are carried out by the same neural resources that store linguistic knowledge.                                   Significance Statement             This study uses fMRI to investigate signatures of working memory (WM) demand during naturalistic story listening, using a broad range of theoretically motivated estimates of WM demand. Results support a strong effect of WM demand in language-selective brain regions but no effect of WM demand in ``multiple demand'' regions that have previously been associated with WM in non-linguistic domains. We further show evidence that WM effects in language regions are distinct from effects of word predictability. Our findings support a core role for WM in incremental language processing, using WM resources that are specialized for language.},

The investigation is based on a corpus of 500 naturallyoccurring apology exchanges, collected through an ethnographic method of observation. The results revealed that (1) explicit expression of apology with a request for forgiveness (bebaxs\textasciicaron id) was the most common apology strategy in Persian. (2) The aforementioned strategy together with acknowledgement of responsibility formed the most frequent combination of apology strategies in this language. (3) The same set of apology strategies used in other investigated languages was common in Persian; however, preferences for using these strategies appeared to be culture-specific.},

Hindi, as it is spoken in A\&N, exhibits certain characteristic traits different from the Hindi spoken in the "mainland", particularly the standard variety. The Andamanese variety of Hindi has evolved in a course of time as a link language among the different speech communities in a socio-economic milieu, quite characteristic of A\&N. The Andamanese Hindi seems to have taken its present shape during the early stages of the settlements of prisoners and convicts in Andaman, who hailed from different parts of India with different linguistic backgrounds .},

  abstract = {Verbal multiword expressions are generally characterized by their formal rigidity, yet they exhibit remarkable diversity in their flexibility. Our primary research question is whether the behavior of idioms is an idiosyncratic property of each idiom or a consequence of more general constraints. We challenge Nunberg et al.'s (1994) proposal, attributing decomposability as the determining factor regarding idioms' flexibility/rigidity, first due to the fuzziness of the notion of decomposability, and second, in light of empirical investigations in English and in other languages that revealed flexibility within idioms previously classified as non-decomposable. We propose an alternative classification that builds on the notions of transparency and figuration. We hypothesize that the more transparent and figurative an idiom is, the more likely it is to be ``transformationally productive''. We put this hypothesis to the test by conducting an empirical corpus-based study of a set of idioms of varying degrees of transparency and figuration, using a large corpus of Modern Hebrew.},

  abstract = {One of the most interesting features of political tradition of pre-modern Northeast India was the presence of local powers tracing their descent from demonic beings. Historical evidence suggests that the demonic royal genealogy was proclaimed at a juncture of transition from pre-state to state society, though the time of transition varied according to the area where it occurred. The nuclear area of the early state of the lower Brahmaputra valley witnessed it in the seventh century, and the spread of state formation from the lower valley to other remote areas of the northeast after the thirteenth century facilitated the dissemination of this lineage model through the agency of brahmins. Asymmetry between the cultural authority of migrant brahmins and peripheral rulers was crucial in this process. Focusing on the Chutiyas and the Dimasas, the local powers established in the fourteenth-century Sadiya area and in the sixteenth-century Cachar hills respectively, the present study will discuss how the descendants of demons were finally approved as kshatriyas; what strategies were employed in this unusual form of legitimation, and how deviation from the traditional demonic lineage occurred. It will help us understand the specificity of political traditions in the peripheral regions of South Asia which cannot be subsumed under the overarching theoretical framework of legitimation.},

Scott's usage of it \textendash{} particularly the emphasis on the ethnic, national, and religious fluidity of highland communities, and their intentionality and agency vis-`a-vis the states with which they engage \textendash{} can be of great utility to those working in the Himalayan region. Through a historical review of the area tradition of `Himalayan studies', as well as an ethnographic sketch of the cross-border Thangmi community of Nepal, India, and China's Tibetan Autonomous Region, I argue that the potential power of the Zomia concept hinges on its ability to provide an additional framework for analysis (and perhaps political struggle), that adds value to, rather than replaces, `traditional' nation-state rubrics.},

  abstract = {The concept of kinship ties among African societies, particular the Ndebele is a strong weapon for promoting peace, stability and conflict management in both the family and the entire community. The kinship structures put in place by the local people have in so many instances proved to be as effective in the maintenance of peace and security as well as respect for human rights .The titles of relationships in most African communities can be precisely referred to as titles of responsibilities, obligations and duties for instance the societal roles assumed by aunts, uncles, mothers, grandparents and senior members (the elderly) serve as societal positions of authority. Culturally, any form of relationship which connects family or community members together comes with a host of expectations. If properly and positively revisited, the concept of kinship ties can assist in finding solutions to the current political and social conflicts in Africa. This paper explores the powerbehind the kinship structures in issues of peace, conflict management and development for use in the contemporary socio-political scene.},

  abstract = {This article discusses how research on language transfer in the field of SLA can help to explain the origins of substrate influence in creoles and provide answers to more difficult questions concerning the distribution and verification of substrate features. First, it argues against the view that both SLA and transfer are not involved in the genesis of pidgin and creole languages. Then the view is presented that, as described in the SLA literature, transfer is not just a consequence of second language learning but also of second language use, and it serves as a communication strategy when the need arises. Such a strategy may be used by speakers of either a prepidgin or an already established pidgin when its functional use is being rapidly extended. Sociolinguistic perspectives on transfer in SLA, described next, throw some light onto the question of why substrate features remain in pidgins and creoles. Research on transfer in SLA also provides important insights into the specific factors that may have affected substrate influence in creoles. Evidence is presented that some transfer constraints discovered in SLA research\textemdash rather than other proposed factors such as so-called functional expendability\textemdash still provide the best explanation for the absence of particular substrate features in creoles. Finally, it is shown that tests proposed for verifying instances of L1 influence in interlanguage could be adapted for verifying instances of substrate influence in creoles.},

Tense/aspect suffixes followed by agent/actor referencing suffixes occur in combination with one of two sets of patient referencing prefixes. Most of the tense/aspect suffixes mark two possible tenses, and the choice of a prefix from a particular set determines the appropriate interpretation. The distinction between imperfective and perfective aspect is central to the Nama tense/aspect system, and the forms of the perfectivity markers depend on the number category of the grammatical arguments: dual versus non-dual, which encompasses both singular and plural (i.e. more than two). At the same time, the agent/actor suffixes and patient referencing prefixes generally index two different number categories: singular versus non-singular. Each of the two basic aspects has three different tenses, with some other aspectual distinctions occurring only with singular arguments. A combination of imperfective and perfective marking is also used.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies on statistical learning (SL) have demonstrated humans' sensitivity to complex statistical properties in their sensory environment. These observations have had a profound impact on the study of language, highlighting statistical aspects of the linguistic input that can be learned from experience, leading to the widespread claim that SL plays a key role in language acquisition and processing. But how can this theorized link be experimentally demonstrated? One increasingly popular avenue comes from studies of individual differences, which tie individual variability in SL to variance in linguistic behavior. This review presents the theoretical advances stemming from this line of research, as well as some of the challenges it currently faces. It contends that while previous studies had an important role in establishing the existence of some coarse-grained link between SL and language, recent developments in SL research suggest that the exact nature of this relationship is more complex than originally conceived and is still far from being fully understood. I specifically discuss three outstanding challenges: (a) understanding individual differences in light of the componential nature of SL, (b) mapping the full array of SL processes given the complexity of real-world statistics, and (c) estimating the strength of current empirical evidence while taking into account both positive and null findings. Confronting these issues, I argue, is a necessary step towards a full theory of the role of SL across language.},

It focuses on the inchoative alternation, comparing it to the Japanese and Hungarian causative alternations. The chapter shows that these alternations differ from one another in important respects, and only the Japanese causative alternation deserves a syntactic decompositional treatment. The chapter thus contributes a critical evaluation of the scope and limitations of syntactic representations of lexical decomposition.},

The social perceptions towards three variants of coda /l/ in Singapore English\textemdash namely dark-l, the variant associated with prescriptive norms, and clear-l and vocalised-l, which are variants that arose through language contact\textemdash are examined. The findings show that clear-l and vocalised-l are associated with specific ethnic groups and have equally diverse meanings, but their meanings have evolved differently; vocalised-l is an emerging local standard, whereas clear-l remains largely stigmatised. Their diverse meanings are shown to be connected by social factors within a network of interrelated signs, and their interpretations are dependent on the hearer's experiences, such that we are observing different parts of the sociolinguistic reality. Restricted experiences with the social world and regulation of social perception are also shown to potentially contribute to accent-based prejudices.

Analyses cover the description of the contours as well as a systematic acoustic analysis, comprising the measurements of F0, duration, pitch excursion and velocity for each syllable in datasets carefully selected from spontaneous speech. Results show that declaratives and imperatives receive a falling contour; interrogatives, either polar or wh questions, can have one of three contours: falling, fall-rise, marked by a rise on the last syllable, or rising. A test on the F0 measurements of each sentence type with a falling contour reveals that they are in effect distinguished by pitch register, ranging from higher to lower, from imperatives to polar questions, to wh questions and statements. Hence, contour shape alone is not sufficient to describe the encoding of sentence types in Jaminjung: overall pitch register is also used. We will argue for the usefulness of instrumental phonetic investigations in describing lesser-known languages and also to enhance our understanding of sentence type characterization in a typological perspective.},

We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis.

In this paper we present a survey of phenomena involving the reduction of adjective agreement in Scandinavian, using examples from Norwegian, and discuss their diachronic origins, including a new account of the development of indeclinability in adjectives such as kry `proud'. These examples each involve lexically restricted non-canonical inflection \textendash{} syncretism, defectiveness, overdifferentiation and periphrasis \textendash{} in particular paradigm cells or syntactic environments. They show that the loss of inflection does not necessarily simplify grammar, and in some cases, can increase grammatical complexity by adding lexical exceptions to general rules. This excludes simplification as the motivation, even if it is the eventual result. We argue from these historical developments that speakers are liable to analyse idiosyncratic patterns of inflection as lexically specified, even where more general (but perhaps more abstract) alternatives are possible. Thus speakers do not always operate with a maximally elegant, reductionist approach to inflection classes.},

There is also a set of locational nouns, which are structured based on an intrinsic frame of reference, at least for some speakers. In the verb phrase, there is a system of five existential verbs, four of which have locational semantics; choice of existential depends on containment and attachment, then secondarily on the animacy of the referent being located. There is also a set of eight directional prefixes. These have different discourse frequencies, reflecting different levels of prefix-verb collocation. In addition, the prefixes primarily occur in perfective clauses and imperatives; however, they are optional when an adverbial phrase is also used. Thus, the system approximates derivation rather than inflection. These patterns of distribution, together with comparative data from other Western Sichuan languages, suggest a grammaticalization pathway from directional prefix to perfective to imperative. .},

This paper describes coverb constructions in Mawng, a nonPama-Nyungan Australian language of the Iwaidjan language family. Although formally similar to those in other Northern Australian languages Mawng coverb constructions form a tight syntactic and semantic unit. The development of Mawng coverb constructions has taken a number of different pathways. Some have developed from productive combinations of verbs and nouns. An unusual typological feature of Mawng termed 'lexicalised agreement' provides a window into the history of Mawng coverb constructions - showing how some coverbs developed from nouns through the intermediate stage of noun-verb idioms. Mawng coverb constructions show how members of a very uniform set of constructions can have different historical origins.},

  abstract = {This article discusses the definitions and scope of phraseology as a domain which is primarily lexical but which very much connects with grammatical issues. We discuss the gradual widening of the scope of phraseology, resulting from the emergence of data-driven, bottom-up analyses of large language corpora. We also note that statistical models of learning and usage-based models of language use converge to provide theoretical support for the claim that language use is to a considerable extent formulaic. An overview of empirical research which supports this claim is provided. We also examine the various schools of linguistic thought which blur the distinction between lexis and grammar, such as the Hallidayan concept of lexicogrammar, valency grammar, pattern grammar, and construction grammar. Our conclusion is that while these and other developments in the field of syntax acknowledge the role of lexis and even attach great importance to it, academic publications which cover typically lexical issues, especially with respect to second language acquisition and use, rarely acknowledge the crucial interconnection between lexis and grammar.},

Its main aim is to evaluate the relative effect of language internal and external factors on the number of cases in the world's languages. I model word order as a language internal predictor; it is wellknown that, for instance, languages with verb-final word order (that is, languages in which both nominal arguments precede the main lexical verb) tend to develop complex case systems more often than languages with SVO word order do. I model population size and the proportion of second language speakers in the speech community as sociolinguistic predictors; these factors have been suggested recently to influence the distribution of the number of cases in the world's languages. Modelling the data with generalized linear mixed effects modelling suggests an interaction between the number of cases, word order, and the proportion of second language speakers on the one hand, and between the number of cases, word order, and population size, on the other. This kind of complex interactions have not been previously reported in typological research wherefore they call for more complex explanations than previously suggested for cross-linguistic variation.},

A classic example of this is the symmetrical interpretation of universally quantified statements like ``Every girl is riding an elephant'', which children often reject as false when they are used to describe a scene with, e.g., three girls each riding an elephant and a fourth elephant without a rider. We present evidence that children's understanding of these sentences is not attributable to syntactic, semantic, or general processing limitations. Instead, in two experiments, we argue that children's behavior stems primarily from difficulty in correctly identifying the speaker's intended ``question under discussion'', and that when this question is made contextually unambiguous, children's judgments are almost completely adultlike.},

In this paper, I examine borrowings which are synonymous (or nearly so) with existing Mangghuer content words. I identify two different structural types of borrowings. Bound synonyms appear only as elements of compounds or fixed expressions, often in onomastic expressions or nouns that have a hyponymic relationship to an existing noun. Free synonyms are borrowed as independent words. Evidence from three disparate types of Mangghuer language data shows that any bound or free synonym may appear in nonce borrowings, idiosyncratic borrowings, or community-wide borrowings, a typology drawn from Poplack (2018). The data suggests that although nonce borrowing is probably common (resulting in nonce synonymy), many Chinese borrowings have become established to varying degrees in the speech community, with the result that Mangghuer has a greatly enriched vocabulary. In compiling an eventual lexicon of Mangghuer, speakers will have to make some difficult decisions about the formal documentation of borrowed synonyms whose use varies widely across the speech community.},

  abstract = {In many theories of language change, ambiguity is put forward as one of the main causes of change. It is thought to be the trigger for syntactic reanalysis, and it is also assumed to cause semantic change. This paper reconsiders the role of ambiguity in change, arguing that its role in change is more complicated. To show this, the role of ambiguity is investigated in the history of English over, as it shifted from preposition to adnumeral marker (as in we have been discussing trivial matters for over three hours). Although syntactic ambiguity between adnumeral and prepositional readings is common, ambiguous uses cannot be shown to significantly predate unambiguously new uses. At the same time, once adnumeral over began to appear in the historical record, it spread more readily to ambiguous contexts. The findings show that syntactic change does not necessarily depend on ambiguous contexts as a trigger of innovation, but the same contexts can facilitate the subsequent spread of an innovation. These conclusions fit a model of change that depends more heavily on analogy as its driving force. It is suggested that similar effects may be at play in semantic change. Finally, it is clear that the mere observation of ambiguity in the historical record is not conclusive evidence of a reanalysis-through-ambiguity type of innovation.},

Based on measures of productivity and  on  idiosyncrasies in meaning that adverb-plus-verb and object-plus-verb combinations   in Greek show, we argue that the phenomena in question are compounds or  affixed  forms that result from the operation of lexical rules. They are thus quintessentially   morphological in nature, rather than syntactic. More generally, we see  this outcome  as an argument against frameworks in which morphology is collapsed into  the  syntactic component and in which morphology is not a separate component  of  grammar.},

These claims have been interpreted formally in feature systems that restrict the possible number distinctions in pronoun systems to four (singular, dual, trial or paucal, and plural). Within the past fifteen years more comprehensive works on number have published documented five number systems in widely available formats. Interestingly, all of the languages used to exemplify five number systems are from the Oceanic subgroup of Austronesian. However, complex number systems, including a five number pronoun system, have developed independently in central Borneo. Although Blust has made this data widely available, central Borneo remains untouched in general discussions of number. The Kenyah languages form a primary branch of the North Sarawak subgroup, located in central Borneo in both Sarawak (Malaysia) and Indonesia. A number of typologically rare features are present in Kenyah, including a pronoun system that includes 5 distinct numbers. Comparative data shows that a five number system can be reconstructed for Proto-Kenyah. This challenges both typological and formal descriptions of number.},

After describing what is known about the origins of TSL itself, it notes that research on TSL began quite late, with the first known article concerning TSL not appearing until the late 1950s (Li 1959). Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, collections of ``Chinese Sign Language'' and Signed Mandarin signs were prepared at schools for the deaf in various parts of Taiwan. The author's own research on TSL began in the mid-1970s with sign collecting and cataloguing, and progressed on through a number of linguistics papers on TSL non-manual signals, word order, compound formation, phonetics and phonology, and eyebrow raising. The first dissertation to be written on TSL was Smith 1989. By then other researchers had begun to look seriously at TSL, and the National Association of the Deaf of the Republic of China had sponsored two TSL textbooks (Smith \& Ting 1979, 1984). In the late 1990s, the author participated in the Taipei City Government's project to develop TSL training materials for sign language interpreters. More recently a number of linguists have joined forces to examine TSL in depth, resulting in projects such as the publication of this special issue of Language and Linguistics. Suggestions for future work include studies of TSL discourse, the production of a comprehensive dictionary of TSL, the preparation of instructional materials at a more advanced level, and research into Deaf history in Taiwan: if those who know this history do not pass it on to the younger generation, it will be lost forever.},

  title = {{{SOCIOLINGUISTIC PATTERNS IN AN UNSTRATIFIED SOCIETY}}: {{THE PATRILECTS OF KUGU NGANHCARA}}},
  author = {Smith, Ian and Johnson, Steve},
  pages = {15},
  abstract = {Considerable sociolinguistic work has been carried out in socially stratified literate societies, where social organization is typically reflected in language by sociolectal stratification oriented towards a standard. Unstratified societies are therefore interesting as potential sources of new types of sociolinguistic data and as testing grounds for sociolinguistic theory and techniques of analysis. Here different principles of social and linguistic organization are found; in particular the lack of an "upper" group means that there is no upper lect to exert a gravitational influence on linguistic organization. This paper reports on the linguistic correlates of social o r ganization among the Nganhcara (Cape York Peninsula, Australia). The Nganhcara are organized into unstratified, generally exogamous, patrilineal clans (PATRICLANS). Actual land-using groups, however, consist of individuals from several different clans. Patrician membership is marked by, among other things, language. Each patrician is associated with a clan-lect, or PATRILECT in our terminology. The patrilects share a common syntax and are differentiated primarily at the lexical level; a few phonological and morphological differences are also found. Despite the linguistic diversity of the land-using groups, children growing up in them identify with and learn their father's patrilect. Most speakers are receptively multi-lectal. There is considerable community agreement as to which features belong to which patrilect. Thus the patrilects are a sociolinguistic as well as a linguistic reality. Nganhcara patrilects differ from traditional sociolects in their lack of stratification and their clear boundaries. Although the patricians are associated with the particular lands they own, patrilects are not geographical dialects in either origin or current distribution. A comparison with the sociolinguistic situation in Sheshatshiu Montagnais (Clarke 1984, 1985) leads to the conclusion that the degree and type of differentiation among the Nganhcara patrilects are attributable to the social importance of the groups they mark and to the linguistically complex environment in which acquisition takes place.},

Theoretical, psycholinguistic as well as computational linguistic research remain puzzled by when and how MWEs receive literal vs. meaning-shifted interpretations, what the contributions of the MWE constituents are to the degree of semantic transparency (i.e., meaning compositionality) of the MWE, and how literal vs. meaning-shifted MWEs are processed and computed. {$<$}br{$>$} This edited volume presents an interdisciplinary selection of six papers on recent findings across linguistic, psycholinguistic, corpus-based and computational research fields and perspectives, discussing the interaction of constituent properties and MWE meanings, and how MWE constituents contribute to the processing and representation of MWEs.

It then uses the linguistic comparative method to determine how languages entering or leaving this area, or coming into increasing contact with it at its edges, have converged with their new neighbours within the past millennium. The results indicate sharp differences in the respective roles and rates of borrowing and calquing, with the latter acting almost exclusively to increase shared colexifications.},

  abstract = {According to Ehrhart and Corne, Tayo is an endogenous creole that crystallized under the peculiarly plantation-like circumstances present at the St-Louis mission in the late 19th century. Noting some linguistic similarities with Reunion Creole, Chaudenson (1994) raises the question of whether Reunion Creole had had any influence on the development of Tayo. This notion is refuted both by Ehrhart (1994) and Corne (1994, 1995, 1999, 2000a, 2000b), although Corne (2000a) concedes that due to some linguistic and socio-demographic evidence, Reunion Creole influence on Tayo cannot be excluded. This paper revisits this debate and reopens questions that earlier researchers appear to have closed by discussing the implications of two texts written in Reunion Creole and published in New Caledonia. The first is a Georges Baudoux text containing the `Reunion Creole' of Socrates, a black Reunion Creole taken to New Caledonia in 1870 to work as a coolie. The second is a political text attacking a `Creole' candidate running for election on the Conseil Sup\'erieur des Colonies published in 1884 by journalist Julien Bernier, an immigrant from Reunion. Accepting the authenticity of these texts raises questions pertinent to the debate on Tayo genesis. Given that r\'eunionnais was being spoken in New Caledonia when Tayo was developing, were any speakers in contact with the Kanaks of St-Louis? What, if any, influence did their language have on the developing St-Louis patois? I discuss these questions by re-examining socio-historical evidence and by making some brief comparisons between the New Caledonian Reunion Creole texts and Tayo.},

On the basis of a sample analysis of coherence relation annotation that resulted in a poor kappa score, we describe the problem and put it into the context of recent literature from the field of computational linguistics on required intercoder agreement. We describe our view on the consequences of the current state of the art and suggest three routes to follow in the coding of coherence relations: double coding (including discussion of disagreements and explicitation of the coding decisions), single coding (including the risk of coder bias, and a lack of generalizability), and enriched kappa statistics (including observed and specific agreement, and a discussion of the ({$\mkern1mu$}possible reasons for) disagreement). We end with a plea for complimentary techniques for testing the robustness of our data with the help of automatic (text mining) techniques.},

Here we test two theories of this asymmetry: one that encodes markedness in the linguistic representation (e.g. Merchant 2014, Sudo \& Spathas 2016, and Saab 2019), and one that traces the asymmetry to differences in the relative frequency of the forms in each pair (Haspelmath 2006). The frequency approach predicts that the size of the asymmetries (as quantified by acceptability judgments) will correlate with the size of the relative frequency ratio for each pair. We test this prediction in two experiments: the first is a curated set of 16 pairs in English, and the second is a test of 58 pairs that nearly exhausts such pairs in English. We use frequencies from COCA (Davies 2008) to test the prediction of the frequency approach. Our results suggest that the relative frequency hypothesis is not an empirically adequate competitor for the explanation of gender asymmetries.},

To test this hypothesis, we looked at submitted manuscripts and peer review activities for all Elsevier journals between February and May 2018-2020, including data on over 5 million authors and referees. Results showed that during the first wave of the pandemic, women submitted proportionally fewer manuscripts than men. This deficit was especially pronounced among more junior cohorts of women academics. The rate of the peer-review invitation acceptance showed a less pronounced gender pattern with women taking on a greater service responsibility for journals, except for health \& medicine, the field where the impact of COVID-19 research has been more prominent. Our findings suggest that the first wave of the pandemic has created potentially cumulative advantages for men.},

  abstract = {Like other socially transmitted traits, human languages undergo cultural evolution. While humans can replicate linguistic conventions to a high degree of fidelity, sometimes established conventions get replaced by new variants, with the gradual replacement following the trajectory of an s-shaped curve. Although previous modelling work suggests that only a bias favoring the replication of new linguistic variants can reliably reproduce the dynamics observed in language change, the source of this bias is still debated. In this paper we compare previous accounts with a momentum-based selection account of language change, a replicator-neutral model where the popularity of a variant is modulated by its momentum, i.e. its change in frequency of use in the recent past. We present results from a multi-agent model that are characteristic of language change, in particular by exhibiting spontaneously generated s-shaped transitions that do not require externally triggered actuation. We discuss several empirical questions raised by our model, pertaining to both momentum-based selection as well as other biases and pressures which have been suggested to influence language change.},

However, it remains unclear how the two laws work together in determining unit length at a given level of linguistic structure. We examine this question regarding the length of morphemes in spoken corpora of nine typologically diverse languages drawn from the DoReCo corpus, showing that Zipf's Law is a stronger predictor, but that the two laws interact with one another. We also explore how this is affected by specific typological characteristics, such as morphological complexity.},

Baining people share a common non-Austronesian ancestral language and similar cultural practices (such as fire dances). An interesting feature of these languages is that they show a great deal of influence from their early Austronesian neighbors. As detailed in the grammar, Mali has characteristics of both the Western Oceanic branch of Austronesian and Trans New Guinea. This is the first comprehensive grammar for a language from the family and provides a framework for further comparative and descriptive research in the region.

  abstract = {Linguists and philosophers since Aristotle have attempted to reduce natural language semantics in general, and the semantics of eventualities in particular, to a `language of mind', expressed in terms of various collections of underlying language-independent primitive concepts. While such systems have proved insightful enough to suggest that such a universal conceptual representation is in some sense psychologically real, the primitive relations proposed, based on oppositions like agent-patient, event-state, etc., have remained incompletely convincing. This chapter proposes that the primitive concepts of the language of mind are `hidden', or latent, and must be discovered automatically by detecting consistent patterns of entailment in the vast amounts of text that are made available by the internet using automatic syntactic parsers and machine learning to mine a form- and language-independent semantic representation language for natural language semantics. The representations involved combine a distributional representation of ambiguity with a language of logical form.},

Data processing often involves choices among several reasonable options for excluding, transforming, and coding data. We suggest that instead of performing only one analysis, researchers could perform a multiverse analysis, which involves performing all analyses across the whole set of alternatively processed data sets corresponding to a large set of reasonable scenarios. Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change because of arbitrary choices in data construction and gives pointers as to which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.},

It provides several case studies and shows how varying collostructional measures can enlighten constructionist analyses of lexical and grammatical constructions. The chapter explains that although adoption of collostructional analysis is a comparatively recent development in Construction Grammar, it has already been applied to a fairly wide range of constructions in the context of research questions ranging from systemic description over language variation and change to language acquisition and processing. It also addresses important methodological issues of collostructional analysis such as the use of inferential statistics, the cognitive mechanisms assumed, as well as the choice of statistical tests.},

The method is framed in a construction-based approach to language, i.e. it assumes that grammar consists of signs (form-meaning pairs) and is thus not fundamentally different from the lexicon. The method is applied to linguistic expressions at various levels of abstraction (words, semi-fixed phrases, argument structures, tense, aspect and mood). The method has two main applications: first, to increase the adequacy of grammatical description by providing an objective way of identifying the meaning of a grammatical construction and determining the degree to which particular slots in it prefer or are restricted to a particular set of lexemes; second, to provide data for linguistic theory-building.},

Semantic universals are restrictions on the variation in meaning exhibit cross-linguistically (e.g., that, in all languages, expressions of a certain type can only denote meanings with a certain special property). This paper pursues an efficient communication analysis to explain the presence of semantic universals in a domain of function words: quantifiers. Two experiments measure how well languages do in optimally trading off between competing pressures of simplicity and informativeness. First, we show that artificial languages which more closely resemble natural languages are more optimal. Then, we introduce information-theoretic measures of degrees of semantic universals and show that these are not correlated with optimality in a random sample of artificial languages. These results suggest both that efficient communication shapes semantic typology in both content and function word domains, as well as that semantic universals may not stand in need of independent explanation.},

Moreover, both prosodic information and its potential orthographic equivalent, i.e., punctuation, have been largely ignored until recently. The unavailability of experimental online methods is one likely reason for this neglect. Here I give an overview of six event-related brain potential (ERP) studies demonstrating that the processing of both prosodic boundaries in natural speech and commas during silent reading can determine syntax parsing immediately. In ERPs, speech boundaries and commas reliably elicit a similar online brain response, termed the Closure Positive Shift (CPS). This finding points to a common mechanism, suggesting that commas serve as visual triggers for covert phonological phrasing. Alternative CPS accounts are tested and the relationship between the CPS and other ERP components, including the P600/SPS, is addressed.},

  abstract = {The `Creolist turn' in Afrikaans historical linguistics is largely based on interpretations of a collection of sentences uttered by 17th/18th century slaves and Khoekhoen, as well as of 20th century Orange River Afrikaans data. A scenario for the emergence of Afrikaans that has come to the fore is that authored by den Besten (1989, 2001a), who assumes that basilectal Cape Dutch varieties were largely based on what he calls Hottentot Hollands, i.e. a pidginized Dutch variety which \textendash{} he argues \textendash{} bears the marks of partial syntactic transfers from Khoekhoe languages. Khoekhoen being regarded as the founders of the Cape Dutch basilect, historians' attention has been focused on Orange River Afrikaans \textendash{} i.e. that Afrikaans variety spoken by the descendants of the Khoekhoen \textendash{} as a possible source of explanations for the crystallization of the distinctive linguistic features of Afrikaans. In the process, the role of other non\textendash European populations at the Cape \textendash{} namely the slaves and Free Blacks \textendash{} has been somewhat neglected. The discovery of a corpus of Cape Malay Dutch literary texts dating back to the 19th century provides a source of information on non\textendash European Cape Dutch varieties likely to refine the existing creolist perspective on the emergence of Afrikaans. In this paper I present the Cape Malay Dutch variety against its general sociolinguistic background, emphasizing its directly recognizable Asian substrate, as well as its un\textendash Dutch features of indeterminate origin. Based on a comparison between the Cape Malay Dutch data and both historical Cape Dutch and synchronic Afrikaans data I argue that Cape Malay Dutch forms the outcome of a non\textendash European Cape Dutch variety that is to be distinguished from Hottentot Hollands.},

The population known as the Bogaiya or Bogaia near to the Strickland River in the Southern Highlands Province are a case in point. Linguistically, affinities between their language and that of the Duna, their neighbors across the Muller Range, have been broached. In cultural terms, through our own fieldwork among the Aluni Valley Duna and in Yeru close to the Strickland, we have also found a range of ideas and ritual practices that link these particular Duna and the Bogaiya, especially practices relating to a Female Spirit figure, the Payame Ima. Duna language and culture features can also be linked with their more populous southern neighbors, the Huli. The Bogaiya conceptually appear or disappear in different ways according to how they are situated in the classifications of linguists and anthropologists. And in their own historical world, forces of recent change brought about by the building of an airstrip and a mission have accelerated a process of their assimilation into the sphere of the Duna. Such processes of shifts in cultural and linguistic identities have probably also formed part of the histories of populations in pre-colonial times, causing discrete groups to appear and disappear, leaving their traces in ethno-historical narratives and traditions.},

  abstract = {Nowadays color in scientific visualizations is standard and extensively used to group, highlight or delineate different parts of data in visualizations. The rainbow color map (also known as jet color map) is famous for its appealing use of the full visual spectrum with impressive changes in chroma and luminance. Besides attracting attention, science has for decades criticized the rainbow color map for its nonlinear and erratic change of hue and luminance along the data variation. The missed uniformity causes a misrepresentation of data values and flaws in science communication. The rainbow color map is scientifically incorrect and hardly decodable for a considerable number of people due to color vision deficiency (CVD) or other vision impairments. Here we aim to raise awareness of how widely used the rainbow color map still is in hydrology. To this end, we perform a paper survey scanning for color issues in around 1000 scientific publications in three different journals including papers published between 2005 and 2020. In this survey, depending on the journal, 16 \%\textendash 24 \% of the publications have a rainbow color map and around the same ratio of papers (18 \%\textendash 29 \%) uses red\textendash green elements often in a way that color is the only possibility to decode the visualized groups of data. Given these shares, there is a 99.6 \% chance to pick at least one visual problematic publication in 10 randomly chosen papers from our survey. To overcome the use of the rainbow color maps in science, we propose some tools and techniques focusing on improvement of typical visualization types in hydrological science. We give guidance on how to avoid, improve and trust color in a proper and scientific way. Finally, we outline an approach how the rainbow color map flaws should be communicated across different status groups in science.},

Previous cross-linguistic research rules out an explanation of this in terms of a universal noun bias; instead, a likely cause is that Chintang verb morphology is polysynthetic and difficult to learn. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the development of Chintang children's noun-to-verb ratio correlates significantly with the extent to which they show a similar flexibility with verbal morphology to that of the surrounding adults, as measured by morphological paradigm entropy. While this development levels off around age three, children continue to have a higher overall noun-to-verb ratio than adults. A likely explanation lies in the kinds of activities that children are engaged in and that are almost completely separate from adults' activities in this culture.},

The well-documented processes of consonantal depletion which lead to the development of phonation-type registers and tones are presented within a general model. Lastly, phonological evolutions observed at advanced stages of segmental depletion are discussed. The concluding note concerns the aftermath of segmental depletion: the recreation of polysyllables.},

The point of departure of the study is Moravcsik's (1978) seminal paper on reduplicative constructions in cross-linguistic perspective. In the main body of the paper, the picture of the geo-linguistic distribution of reduplication that is painted in the World Atlas of Language Structures (Haspelmath et al. 2005) is critically evaluated. The results of the evaluation serve as background for the discussion of the current stalemate of opinions in the ongoing discussion of the supposed universality of reduplication. To resolve the impasse, a prototype-based approach is sketched which may allow us to recommence the collection of empirical data on an unprejudiced basis.},

This paper shows that this is expected if (i) morphological paradigms are required to be both as small and as unambiguous as possible, (ii) languages may prioritize these requirements differently, and (iii) probability distributions for grammatical features interacting in syncretic patterns are fixed across languages. More specifically, this approach predicts that grammatical contexts that are less probable or more informative about a target grammatical feature T should favor syncretism of T cross-linguistically. The paper provides evidence for these predictions based on four detailed case studies involving well-known patterns of contextual syncretism (gender syncretism based on number, gender syncretism based on person, aspect syncretism based on tense, and case syncretism based on animacy).},

Karitiana is the sole surviving language of the Arik6m family (Tupi Stock), spoken today by approximately 200 people living in their own demarcated teservation located 95 Km south of Porto Velho, in the state of Rondonia, Brazil. Chapter 1 describes and analyzes the segmental phonology of the language. With respect to segmental features, special attention is given to the consonants of the nasal series, which undergo partial oralization in environments contiguous to oral vowels. I claim that this phenomenon gives support to the hypothesis that nasality must be represented as a binary feature. Another phenomenon of theoretical interest in Karitiana phonology is vocalic epenthesis, which is triggered by syllabification word-internally and by syllabification as well as stress clash avoidance in certain phrasal environments. I explain the interactions between epenthesis and stress assignment in a derivational model of cyclic phonology. Chapter 2 describes the pitch accent system of the language, in which tones are assigned to the same metrical plane in which stress is computed. In chapter 3, I show that the language is verb-final and that the verb obligatorily raises to the complementizer position (C) in matrix clauses to check tense and agreement features. In dependent clauses, the verb is final, and no agreement or tense is present. I draw a parallel between Karitiana and Germanic verb second languages: in both systems the matrix tensed verb must surface in C, and a phrase must fill Spec,CP. The latter is only a tendency in Karitiana. Standard agreement is nominative (absolutive), although whenever the object is A-bar moved to the focus position (Spec,CP) in nondeclarative focused clauses, the verb shows ergative agreement. I argue that the functional morphology inserted as a focus marker deactivates the agreement features of I, the functional head that would normally covertly agree with the ergative subject, and as a result, the other functional head bearing agreement features (C) agrees with the ergative subject. Chapter 5 describes other instances of non-declarative and declarative focus constructions.},

This distinction is commonly operationalized through concreteness ratings based on the aggregated judgments of many people. What is often overlooked in experimental studies using this operationalization is that ratings are attributed to               words               , not to concepts directly. In this paper we explore the relationship between the linguistic properties of English words and conceptual abstractness/concreteness. Based on hypotheses stated in the existing linguistic literature we select a set of variables (part of speech, morphological structure, countability, etymology) and verify whether they are statistically associated with concreteness ratings. We show that English nouns are rated as more concrete compared to other parts of speech, but mass nouns are rated as less concrete than count nouns. Furthermore, a more complex morphological structure is associated with abstractness, and as for etymology, French- and Latin-derived words are more abstract than words of other origin. This shows that linguistic properties of words are indeed associated with the degree of concreteness that we attribute to the underlying concepts, and we discuss the implications that these findings have for linguistic theory and for empirical investigations in the cognitive sciences.},

  abstract = {I'm a big boy, you're a baby': How do such phrases do the vital work of managing young children's peer interactions? We trace the function of such phrases as they were used over an 18-month period by young children (2; 6 - 4; 11) who attended a New Zealand an early childhood centre. Using interactional sociolinguistics methods of analysis we examine how children used particular phrases within their community of practice to manage their peer interactions and to mark out individual and group identities through inclusion and exclusion. The phrases we analyse are labels (big boys; baby); we document changes in the way they were used productively: there is `ownership' of them; then they are re-purposed; and then some disappear. By viewing peer interactions as phenomena that include a temporal dimension, we trace how each phrase helped to establish individual and group identities that were constantly open to negotiation. We argue the need for greater attention to children's use of language to improve our understanding of children's lived experiences of peer interactions including inclusion and exclusion processes in early childhood settings.},

  abstract = {So, your prof has decided on a science communication project that combines images and text in the form of an infographic. This manual is designed to help you get started on creating an Infographic for a class science communications project that will become an open access educational resource. The manual contains general sci-comms guidance, instructions for how to author and license your new open access work, as well as information about image rights and referencing, and a design guide. The design guide provides pointers to help you to combine text and images in ways that are interesting without being overwhelming for your audience. The manual was first created by Prof Primate for students of `An Ape's Guide to Human Language,' a second-year course in Psychology at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. In our class, everyone is randomly allocated a primate as their target species for individualized project work. This means everyone in the class helps to build up our collective knowledge about primates, to be shared in a Festival at the end of semester. At the end of the manual are additional instructions for the Sci-Comms Project for An Ape's Guide to Human Language in S2 of 2021, NTU Singapore. Prof Primate hopes this manual will be useful for students of all subjects, and may inspire more Profs to incorporate Open Access Comms projects (Sci-Comms, Ling-Comms etc) into their assessable work.},

  abstract = {Can diversity make for better science? Although diversity has ethical and political value, arguments for its epistemic value require a bridge between normative and mechanistic considerations, demonstrating why and how diversity benefits collective intelligence. However, a major hurdle is that the benefits themselves are rather mixed: quantitative evidence from psychology and behavioral sciences sometimes shows a positive epistemic effect of diversity, but often shows a null effect, or even a negative effect. Here we argue that, in order to make progress with these why and how questions, we need first to rethink when one ought to expect a benefit of cognitive diversity. In doing so, we highlight that the benefits of cognitive diversity are not equally distributed about collective intelligence tasks, and are best seen for complex, multistage, creative problem solving, during problem posing and hypothesis generation. Throughout, we additionally outline a series of mechanisms relating diversity and problem complexity, and show how this perspective can inform meta-science questions.},

  pages = {25},
  abstract = {This paper is an historical study of the formation of the Chinese resultative verb compounds (RVCs) that signal a resultant state of a non-agent with a V1V2 predicate. Metaphorization and metonymization, understood within the theoretical framework of Brinton \& Traugott (2005), are proposed to have played a most important role in the formation of the RVC in Middle Chinese. Many scholars noted (Wang 1958, Ota 1958, and Mei 1991) that the Modern Chinese RVCs as a linguistic form did not exist in Old Chinese. Mei (1991) further claimed that the neutralization of the second verb in a matching transitive verb-verb sequence gave rise to the present-date RVC with a transitive-intransitive format. This paper, however, demonstrates that, in light of the polysemous structure of many verbs and Levin \& Hovav's theory on argument realization (2005), the ambitransitive nature of the verbs in these verbal sequences ultimately was responsible for the unification of the two verbs as a process of metonymization exemplified by hyperbole and its spread as a process of metaphorization. Moreover, it is also argued that, on the basis of several formal distinctions, Chinese RVCs can be separated into two different categories: those resulting from lexicalization and those resulting from grammaticalization.},

The similarity between TSL and CSL are due to language contact. TSL and American Sign Language (ASL) are least similar. Signs with iconic motivation are prevalent and universal in sign languages.

No published grammar or dictionary is available for Nalca, but a translation of the New Testament was used as a parallel text. The results showed that Nalca is splitergative, strongly suffixing and agglutinating, with subject-object-verb (SOV) as the dominant word order. Verbs consist of a stem and a series of suffixes expressing tense/aspect/mood, negation, number and person. The case alignment is ergative-absolutive for nouns, for which syntactic function is indicated by a series of postpositions. These postpositions agree with nouns in gender. Ergativity was not observed for pronouns; while the results were inconclusive, they appeared to show a nominativeaccusative case alignment. The numeral system is an extended body-part system with the base 27. Many of the features found in Nalca are comparable with other Mek languages, with the gender system and split-ergativity being two major exceptions. Finally, the use of the New Testament as a parallel text was a success, with a basic description of the grammar of Nalca having been made, although further investigation is needed.},

In a Minimalist framework, specific parameters cannot be invoked to allow or disallow different kinds of serial verbs, light verbs, resultatives, and so on. Instead, what variation is observed must come from the specifications of lexical items. This places a great burden on the learner, a burden which, I argue, is partly alleviated by the functional sequence.},

Six to five thousand years ago, this former inland sea would have allowed an almost direct exchange of ideas and products between the people inhabiting its shoreline and the highlands. This was also a period of growing contact with Asia, as attested by the 5800 BP betel-nut husk excavated from the Dongan marine midden and the pre-Lapita pottery found in the north coast sites and in the highlands at Wanlek. Such finds challenge the assumption that Lepita pottery signals the entry of Austronesian speakers throughout Melanesia.},

  abstract = {People divide their ongoing experience into meaningful events. This process, event segmentation, is strongly associated with visual input: when visual features change, people are more likely to segment. However, the nature of this relationship is unclear. Segmentation could be bound to specific visual features, such as actor posture. Or, it could be based on changes in the activity that are correlated with visual features. This study distinguished between these two possibilities by examining whether segmentation varies across first- and thirdperson perspectives. In two experiments, observers identified meaningful events in videos of actors performing everyday activities, such as eating breakfast or doing laundry. Each activity was simultaneously recorded from a first-person perspective and a third-person perspective. These videos presented identical activities but differed in their visual features. If segmentation is tightly bound to visual features then observers should identify different events in first- and third-person videos. In addition, the relationship between segmentation and visual features should remain unchanged. Neither prediction was supported. Though participants sometimes identified more events in first-person videos, the events they identified were mostly indistinguishable from those identified for third-person videos. In addition, the relationship between the video's visual features and segmentation changed across perspectives, further demonstrating a partial dissociation between segmentation and visual input. Event segmentation appears to be robust to large variations in sensory information as long as the content remains the same. Segmentation mechanisms appear to flexibly use sensory information to identify the structure of the underlying activity.},

My broader de\textregistered nition of performativity treats it as mental-space blending (in Fauconnier and Turner's terminology) wherein structure is transferred from a representing space to the space represented. Performative uses of metaphorical representations (pervasive in ritual and magic) are treated alongside literal cases, using our well-developed system for representing metaphor in terms of metal space blends. This approach oers a general treatment of the ways in which linguistic and non-linguistic representations (e.g., ritual enactments or pictures) are understood to aect reality.},

As an ethnolinguistically diverse region, the Amdo Sprachbund constitutes a natural laboratory for the study of language contact and human interaction at large. Unsurprisingly, populations within the Amdo Sprachbund show considerable signs of genetic admixture which sometimes result in disagreement between genetic structure and linguistic affiliation. More remarkably, their languages appear to show varying degrees of structural convergence towards Amdo Tibetan depending on their religious practice. To wit, syllable-initial consonant clusters and a three-term evidential system, two features which are clearly attributable to Tibetic influence, are only found in languages whose speakers practise(d) Tibetan Buddhism. These observations suggest that genetic and various sociohistorical factors should be taken into account in the study of areal linguistics.},

  abstract = {Decades of works dedicated to the description of (previously) lesserknown Sinitic languages have effectively dispelled the common myth that these languages share a single ``universal Chinese grammar''. Yet, the underlying cause of their grammatical variation is still a matter for debate. This paper focuses on typological variation across Sinitic varieties. Through comparing the typological profiles of various Sinitic languages with those of their Altaic and Mainland Southeast Asian (MSEA) neighbors, we discuss to what extent the variation within the Sinitic branch can be attributed to areal diffusion. Taking into account over 360 language varieties of seven different genetic affiliations (Sinitic, Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, Hmong-Mien, Tai-Kadai, Austroasiatic) and 30 linguistic features, we conduct a typological survey with the aid of the phylogenetic program NeighborNet. Our results suggest that convergence towards their non-Sinitic neighbors has likely played a pivotal role in the typological diversity of Sinitic languages. Based primarily on their degree of Altaic/MSEA influence, the Sinitic varieties in our database are classified into four areal groups, namely 1) Northern, 2) Transitional, 3) Central Southeastern, 4) Far Southern. This classification scheme reflects the intricate interplay between areal convergence, regional innovations, and retention of archaic features.},

It formerly also had other names used by outsiders, including Yeren (Chinese               yeren               `wild people'), and Yawyin in Burma and Yobin in India (both derived from the Chinese term). Other names included Lisaw from the Shan and Thai name for the group, also seen in the former Burmese name Lishaw. About two-thirds of the speakers live in China, especially in north-western Yunnan Province, but also scattered elsewhere in Yunnan and Sichuan. About a quarter live in the Kachin State and the northern Shan State in Burma, with a substantial number in Chiangmai, Chiangrai and other provinces of Thailand, and a few thousand in Arunachal Pradesh in India. It is also spoken as a second language by many speakers of Nusu, Anung, Rawang and others in north-western Yunnan and northern Burma. Lisu has almost completely replaced Anung in China and is replacing Lemei in China. The Lisu are one of the 55 national minorities recognised in China, one of 135 ethnic groups recognised in Burma, a scheduled (officially listed and recognised) tribe in India, and one of the recognised hill tribe groups of Thailand. Figure 1 shows a map of the area where Lisu is spoken.},

A prominent solution to misalignments in wordhood domains is to distinguish between grammatical (morphosyntactic, morphological) words and phonological (prosodic) words. Recent studies reveal problems with this solution insofar as it is meant to serve as a basis for cross-linguistic comparison. Language-internal divergences within morphosyntactic domains and the phonological domains are not straightforwardly handled by the grammatical-phonological word distinction. Moreover, cross-linguistic variation in the motivation for these constituents is such that it is not clear that the grammatical/phonological word of one language is comparable to that of the next. Recent descriptive and typological studies seek to overcome these problems by questioning some of the methodological and conceptual assumptions underlying the concept of a word and the interpretation of wordhood diagnostics.},

And yet, how such sensitivity develops throughout the course of learning remains unclear. We investigated this question in human adults performing a visual SL task, in which the transition probability among stimuli varied systematically across learning sessions. Hippocampal activity acutely reflected this cross-session change and was predictive of behavioral performance. Using a hidden Markov model to decode stimulus patterns from hippocampal activity, we observed a ``mere-exposure'' effect, such that brief experience with the temporally structured stimuli was sufficient to alter the hippocampal processing. As learning unfolded, feedback from the repeated exposure shaped the hippocampal processing to better accommodate the environmental statistics. Our findings provide direct evidence of how experience with associative patterns sculpts hippocampal activity in a nonlinear fashion, bringing new insight to its active role in SL.},

  abstract = {The average predictability (aka informativity) of a word in context has been shown to condition word duration (Seyfarth, 2014). All else being equal, words that tend to occur in more predictable environments are shorter than words that tend to occur in less predictable environments. One account of the informativity effect on duration is that the acoustic details of probabilistic reduction are stored as part of a word's mental represen\- tation. Other research has argued that predictability effects are tied to prosodic structure in integral ways. With the aim of assessing a potential prosodic basis for informativity effects in speech production, this study extends past work in two directions; it investigated informativity effects in another large language, Mandarin Chinese, and broadened the study beyond word duration to additional acoustic dimensions, pitch and intensity, known to index prosodic prominence. The acoustic information of content words was extracted from a large telephone conversation speech corpus with over 400,000 tokens and 6000 word types spoken by 1655 individuals and analyzed for the effect of informativity using frequency statistics estimated from a 431 million word subtitle corpus. Results indicated that words with low informativity have shorter durations, replicating the effect found in English. In addition, informativity had significant effects on maximum pitch and intensity, two phonetic di\- mensions related to prosodic prominence. Extending this interpretation, these results suggest that predictability is closely linked to prosodic prominence, and that the lexical representation of a word includes phonetic details associated with its average prosodic prominence in discourse. In other words, the lexicon absorbs prosodic in\- fluences on speech production.},

  abstract = {Spatial reference systems have been investigated across many different languages and cultures, partly with the explicit aim of identifying preferred ways of thinking and talking about space in a particular culture. This paper addresses variability within a given language (and culture) by looking at diversity across everyday specialist domains. Wherever a domain requires people to interact with space in a specific way, conventions for thinking and talking about space arise that are far less common outside those domains. For instance, in sailing it is almost impossible to talk about `forward movement', due to the various forces acting on the boat; these require the sailor to calculate a useful course relative to the goal direction. Based on a range of examples, this paper explores customary ways of talking about space across various domains, and highlights the underlying spatial-conceptual reference systems. This demonstrates how different situational domains call for different reference systems, contrary to beliefs that entire cultures can be associated with stable preferences for a specific reference system.},

  abstract = {Sumi (also known by its exonym `Sema') is a Tibeto-Burman language spoken in Nagaland, North-east India. It is one of the major languages of the state, with an estimated 242,000 speakers living primarily in Zunheboto district, as well as in the major cities of Kohima and Dimapur. Bradley (1997) places Sumi (referred to as Sema), among the `Southern Naga' languages, which include Angami (also known as Tenyidie) and Ao, in contrast to the `Northern Naga' languages such as Konyak and Nocte. Burling (2003) offers a more conservative classification, placing Sumi (referred to as Simi) in an `Angami-Pochuri' group containing Angami, Chakhesang (Chokri and Kheza) and Mao. Four main dialects of Sumi have been identified: the Western dialect, the Eastern dialect, the Chizolimi dialect, and the Central dialect. The Central dialect is the standard dialect used in published works of Sumi (Sreedhar 1976: 4\textendash 5).},

In these two varieties, we find preliminary evidence that in both monosyllabic and disyllabic words, lexical tone is only specified at the left edge of the word, while the right edge of the word is `free' to take post-lexical intonation tones. We present evidence of post-lexical intonation on these `free' right edges both phrase medially and phrase finally. These results suggest that a description of the tone system of these languages without reference to the intonational system is too simplistic, and any future analyses should incorporate descriptions of both lexical tone and post-lexical intonation.},

  abstract = {Research by Van Rooy and Terblanche (2009) has shown that non-native students use nominalisations less than native speakers when writing. The frequency and use of nominalisations is examined across different spoken and written registers of black South African English corpora and first language corpora. The aim of the study is to explain the fairly similar frequency of nominalisations in second language and first language texts, as well as to examine possible functional differences between types of nominalisations, for example, abstract versus concrete. Differences regarding the type of suffix, the frequencies of suffixes in the corpora, mode and nativeness are examined. There seems to be a link between texts that are informationally dense (Biber, 1988) and nominalisations characterised by semantic complexity. Nominalisations with heavy semantic loadings will probably be more common in texts with an informational focus than in conversation. According to Biber et al. (1999: 322) nominalisations are typically associated with informationally dense texts, as opposed to greater involvement on the part of the reader and writer of a text. Biber et al. (1999: 322) also state that the relative difference between registers is much more visible for derived nouns than for nouns as a whole. However, studies done by Biber (1988) and Biber et al. (1999) only focus on four frequently used suffixes: -tion, -ment, -ness and -ity, all suffixes that are used to derive abstract nouns. The present study analyses a more elaborate list of nominalisations than Biber's 1988 study.},

In this paper, we provide a review of the literature on the utility of metaphor, describing key findings and controversies while underscoring recent experimental and theoretical advances. We begin with a brief introduction to metaphor and offer a critical assessment of the claim that conventional metaphors in language reflect underlying conceptual representations and processing, a view associated with Lakoff and Johnson's groundbreaking conceptual metaphor theory (CMT). We then discuss recent research that examines whether and how metaphor shapes attitudes and reasoning, outlining some of the cognitive, affective, and social forces that moderate the efficacy of metaphors on decision making. Throughout the paper, we highlight theoretical implications of the research and identify challenges that warrant further investigation in the study of metaphor. In the end, this work paints a complex and dynamic view of metaphor in communication and cognition.},

If we look at the number of language descriptions for which there is no corresponding accessible primary data, it would seem that creating persistent, well-structured, and citable language records has proven to be a considerable barrier to linguists in the past. This chapter seeks to provide such advice by focusing on the nuts and bolts of the creation and management of sustainable data in the course of linguistic field research, including pre-fieldwork planning and the follow-up archiving, annotation, and analysis of field-collected materials. The approach to data management presented here assumes that it is the professional responsibility of linguists to create long-lasting, archivable primary data and to situate any subsequent analyses in that data. The article further advocates the use of appropriate technologies to record, manage and annotate linguistic data, in order to create good records of the languages that are studied and also provide data upon which we make generalizations. This article aims to help find the balance between the desire to record and annotate the data to the highest possible standards, and the reality of the time constraints we all work under.},

Cultural accumulation of innovative algorithms is hard to explain because complex concepts are difficult to pass on. We found that selective social learning preserved rare discoveries of exceptional algorithms in a large experimental simulation of cultural evolution. Participants (               N               = 3450) faced a difficult sequential decision problem (sorting an unknown sequence of numbers) and transmitted solutions across 12 generations in 20 populations. Several known sorting algorithms were discovered. Complex algorithms persisted when participants could choose who to learn from but frequently became extinct in populations lacking this selection process, converging on highly transmissible lower-performance algorithms. These results provide experimental evidence for hypothesized links between sociality and cognitive function in humans.                        ,              Humans succeed through social learning                            Our capacity to accumulate complex algorithms over generations allows human beings to adapt to diverse environments and solve challenges that go beyond our individual limitations. However, cultural accumulation of innovative algorithms is difficult to explain. Thompson               et al               . studied a large number of participants to explore the evolution of algorithms under different learning conditions (see the Perspective by Henrich). Selective social learning that involved knowledge of the success level of different strategies or of different models preserved difficult-to-invent, efficient algorithms more than random social learning or one-attempt asocial learning. Two efficient algorithms were used by many people, but the most efficient one only spread under selective social learning. \textemdash PRS                        ,              An experimental simulation of cultural evolution shows that selecting who to learn from is key to maintaining complex discoveries.},

They adduce evidence from linguistics, archaeology, and genetics to support their claim. An admirable feature of the Robbeets et al.'s paper is that all their datasets can be accessed. However, a closer investigation of all three types of evidence reveals fundamental problems with each of them. Robbeets et al.'s analysis of the linguistic data does not conform to the minimal standards required by traditional scholarship in historical linguistics and contradicts their own stated sound correspondence principles. A reanalysis of the genetic data finds that they do not conclusively support the farming-driven dispersal of Turkic, Mongolian, and Tungusic, nor the two-wave spread of farming to Korea. Their archaeological data contain little phylogenetic signal, and we failed to reproduce the results supporting their core hypotheses about migrations.                      Given the severe problems we identify in all three parts of the ``triangulation'' process, we conclude that there is neither conclusive evidence for a Transeurasian language family nor for associating the five different language families with the spread of Neolithic farmers from the West Liao River region.},

For example, whether the language community is predominantly urban or rural may motivate its reliance on relative or absolute reference frame (Dasen and Mishra 2010; Pederson 1993, 2006). This review paper contributes to Sociotopography in two ways: first, by showing that the distribution of reference frames reported in the literature corresponds to deaf community sign languages and village sign languages (thus the urban-rural differences generalize across modalities), and second, that deaf community sign languages all allow their users to employ a conflated intrinsic-relative frame, which is possibly due to affordances of the visual-manual modality (a modality-specific feature). Comparing the visual-manual and the aural-oral modalities therefore shows that some variation in spatial descriptions correlates with the environment regardless of the modality used, but also highlights modality-specific properties.},

  abstract = {Recent research on the acoustic realization of affixes has revealed differences between phonologically homophonous affixes, e.g. the different kinds of final [s] and [z] in English (Plag, Homann \& Kunter 2017, Zimmermann 2016a). Such results are unexpected and unaccounted for in widely accepted post-Bloomfieldian item-and-arrangement models (Hockett 1954), which separate lexical and post-lexical phonology, and in models which interpret phonetic effects as consequences of different prosodic structure. This paper demonstrates that the differences in duration of English final S as a function of the morphological function it expresses (non-morphemic, plural, third person singular, genitive, genitive plural, cliticized               has               , and cliticized               is               ) can be approximated by considering the support for these morphological functions from the words' sublexical and collocational properties. We estimated this support using na\"ive discriminative learning and replicated previous results for English vowels (Tucker, Sims \& Baayen 2019), indicating that segment duration is lengthened under higher functional certainty but shortened under functional uncertainty. We discuss the implications of these results, obtained with a wide learning network that eschews representations for morphemes and exponents, for models in theoretical morphology as well as for models of lexical processing.},

Linguistics Vanguard 1(1). 327\textendash 337 introduce a skeptical view of recent studies into the embodied character of metaphorical source domains. According to the authors, there cannot be conclusive evidence on the matter thus far, since, for a metaphor to be embodied, specific simulations must be modalityspecific and not simply restricted to modality-specific activity brain areas. In line with this, I argue that metaphors reflect a connection between perception, memory, and consciousness (embodied extended mind). The Embodied Extended Mind Theory (EEMT) introduced in this paper is indebted to Active Inference (AIF), a process theory for the comprehension of intelligent agency. EEMT defends the idea that language bears traces of nonlinguistic, bodily acquired information that reflects biological processes of energy exchange and conservation. Therefore, it is assumed that what makes a metaphor embodied is not only the relation between a source domain and a target domain in ad hoc regions in the brain, but the alignment of multiple independent systems during the (re)construction of events. Central to this is the idea that humans use stored perceptual maps, the combination of which permits us to manipulate concepts as part of complex event partitioning.},

The analysis is concerned with the demarcation of prosodic levels in the language, namely the Accentual Phrase and the Intonation Phrase. First impressionistic descriptions of Drehu state there is fixed word initial stress, however recent experimental evidence does not support this claim. Instead, it has been suggested that Drehu could be an edge-marking language which relies on right boundary marking. To determine whether the patterns recorded in the literature are borne out, the phonological and phonetic realisation of post-lexical word level prosody is investigated. An experiment was conducted to examine the extent to which fundamental frequency (F0) and duration contribute to boundary marking in Drehu. The results show that F0 cues mark the right boundary of two prosodic levels, the AP and IP, and that the strength of the boundary is related to its level in the prosodic hierarchy. Preboundary lengthening also cues IP boundaries but not AP boundaries.},

Linguistics 45(4). 765\textendash 814) analysis of the correlation between the position of a `when'-phrase and the temporal reference of a bare sentence in Vietnamese. Bare sentences in Vietnamese, based on (Smith, Carlota S. \& Mary S. Erbaugh. 2005. Temporal interpretation in Mandarin Chinese. Linguistics 43(4). 713\textendash 756), are argued to obtain their temporal interpretation from their aspectual composition, and the default temporal reference: bounded events are located in the past, unbounded events at present. It is shown that the correlation so observed in when-questions is superficial, and is tied to the syntax and semantics of temporal modification and the requirement that temporal adverbials denoting future time is base generated in sentence-initial position, and past time adverbials in sentence-final position. A `when'-phrase, being temporally underspecified, obtains its temporal value from its base position. However, the correlation between word order and temporal reference in argument wh-questions and declaratives is factual, depending on whether the predicate-argument configuration allows for a telic interpretation or not. To be specific, it is dependent on whether the application of Generic Modification (Snyder, William. 2012. Parameter theory and motion predicates. In Violeta Demonte \& Louise McNally (eds.), Telicity, change, and state. Acrosscategorial view of event structure, 279\textendash 299.

From the perspective of signalling theory, these investments in highly complex artistic designs can reflect information about individuals and their social standing. Using a large corpus of kolam art from South India (N = 3139 kolam from 192 women), we test a number of hypotheses about the ways in which social stratification and individual differences affect the complexity of artistic designs. Consistent with evolutionary signalling theories of constrained optimisation, we find that kolam art tends to occupy a `sweet spot' at which artistic complexity, as measured by Shannon information entropy, remains relatively constant from small to large drawings. This stability is maintained through an observable, apparently unconscious trade-off between two standard information-theoretic measures: richness and evenness. Although these drawings arise in a highly stratified, caste-based society, we do not find strong evidence that artistic complexity is influenced by the caste boundaries of Indian society. Rather, the trade-off is likely due to individual-level aesthetic preferences and differences in skill, dedication and time, as well as the fundamental constraints of human cognition and memory.},

  abstract = {In large, complex societies, assorting with others with similar social norms or behaviors can facilitate successful coordination and cooperation. The ability to recognize others with shared norms or behaviors is thus assumed to be under selection. As a medium of communication, human art might reflect fitness-relevant information on shared norms and behaviors of other individuals thus facilitating successful coordination and cooperation. Distinctive styles or patterns of artistic design could signify migration history, different groups with a shared interaction history due to spatial proximity, as well as individual-level expertise and preferences. In addition, cultural boundaries may be even more pronounced in a highly diverse and socially stratified society. In the current study, we focus on a large corpus of an artistic tradition called kolam that is produced by women from Tamil Nadu in South India (N = 3, 139 kolam drawings from 192 women) to test whether stylistic variations in art can be mapped onto caste boundaries, migration and neighborhoods. Since the kolam art system with its sequential drawing decisions can be described by a Markov process, we characterize variation in styles of art due to different facets of an artist's identity and the group affiliations, via hierarchical Bayesian statistical models. Our results reveal that stylistic variations in kolam art only weakly map onto caste boundaries, neighborhoods, and regional origin. In fact, stylistic variations or patterns in art are dominated by artist-level variation and artist expertise. Our results illustrate that although art can be a medium of communication, it is not necessarily marked by group affiliation. Rather, artistic behavior in this context seems to be primarily a behavioral domain within which individuals carve out a unique niche for themselves to differentiate themselves from others. Our findings inform discussions on the evolutionary role of art for group coordination by encouraging researchers to use systematic methods to measure the mapping between specific objects or styles onto groups.},

  abstract = {With the advancement of cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychological research, the field of language neurobiology is at a cross-roads with respect to its framing theories. The central thesis of this article is that the major historical framing model, the Classic ``Wernicke-Lichtheim-Geschwind'' model, and associated terminology, is no longer adequate for contemporary investigations into the neurobiology of language. We argue that the Classic model (1) is based on an outdated brain anatomy; (2) does not adequately represent the distributed connectivity relevant for language, (3) offers a modular and ``language centric'' perspective, and (4) focuses on cortical structures, for the most part leaving out subcortical regions and relevant connections. To make our case, we discuss the issue of anatomical specificity with a focus on the contemporary usage of the terms ``Broca's and Wernicke's area'', including results of a survey that was conducted within the language neurobiology community. We demonstrate that there is no consistent anatomical definition of ``Broca's and Wernicke's Areas'', and propose to replace these terms with more precise anatomical definitions. We illustrate the distributed nature of the language connectome, which extends far beyond the single-pathway notion of arcuate fasciculus connectivity established in Geschwind's version of the Classic Model. By illustrating the definitional confusion surrounding ``Broca's and Wernicke's areas'', and by illustrating the difficulty integrating the emerging literature on perisylvian white matter connectivity into this model, we hope to expose the limits of the model, argue for its obsolescence, and suggest a path forward in defining a replacement.},

What are the properties of language users such that we can account for these characteristics? To address this question, we built a computational model of a social network of language users. By holding the network structure constant and varying properties of the language users, we found that language change reflects both the structure of social networks and properties of language users. In particular, our results suggest that although language users must be capable of probabilistically accessing multiple grammars, they must prefer to access a single grammar categorically.},

Through qualitative data analysis, we examine students' apprehensions and motivations to publish their artifacts. We find that key motivators are a sense of belonging, personal reward, and an active contribution to a culture of collaboration, whereas apprehensions are grounded in concerns about the quality of their work, uncertainties about licensing, and fear of vulnerability through visibility. We show that open science practices and OEP can be combined synergistically in process-oriented, research-based, and collaborative seminar concepts, and we formulate recommendations for lecturers on how to successfully address OEP in the classroom.},

The chapter addresses two related questions: First, what are the logical underpinnings of the relationship between events and their parts? Second, how do we recognize, or individuate, events? Both of these are addressed through the lens of parallels with the domain of individuals. With respect to the first, the chapter summarizes foundational work by Link and others on mereological relations between events and individuals. With respect to the second, it proposes that events can be individuated in different ways, depending on whether they are perceived as purely physical, as intentional, or other.},

We compared two sets of predictors, reflecting two different approaches to speech production, one based on competition between word forms, the other based on principles of discrimination learning. Classical measures in word form competition theories such as word frequency, lexical density, and gang size (types of vocalic alternation) were predictive of stem vowel duration. However, more precise predictions were obtained using measures derived from a two-layer network model trained on the Buckeye corpus. Measures representing strong bottom-up support predicted longer vowel durations. Conversely, measures reflecting uncertainty predicted shorter vowel durations, including a measure of the verb's semantic density. The learning-based model also suggests that it is not a verb's frequency as such that gives rise to shorter vowel duration, but rather a verb's collocational diversity. Results are discussed with reference to the Smooth Signal Redundancy Hypothesis and the Paradigmatic Signal Enhancement Hypothesis.},

However, there is little understanding of the functional connection between diversification or extinction in languages and species, or the relationship between linguistic and species richness across different spatial scales. New Guinea is the world's most linguistically rich region and contains extremely high biological diversity. We demonstrate significant positive relationships between language and mammal richness in New Guinea across multiple spatial scales, revealing a likely functional relationship over scales at which infra-island diversification may occur. However, correlations are driven by spatial congruence between low levels of language and species richness. Regional biocultural richness may have showed closer congruence before New Guinea's linguistic landscape was altered by Holocene demographic events. In contrast to global studies, we demonstrate a significant negative correlation across New Guinea between areas with high levels of threatened languages and threatened mammals, indicating that landscape-scale threats differ between these groups. Spatial resource prioritization to conserve biodiversity may not benefit threatened languages, and conservation policy must adopt a multi-faceted approach to protect biocultural diversity as a whole.},

He argues that it constitutes evidence for a partly-unified postsyntactic module, in which morphology and prosody are built in parallel (by `Optimality-Theoretic Distributed Morphology'). We argue that the pattern Rolle identifies in Degema SVCs instead results from the simultaneous interaction of two independently-attested syntax-prosody phenomena: (1) the pressure for adjacent verbs in an SVC to form a single prosodic unit, and (2) the suppression of redundant agreement within a single prosodic word (a.k.a. `Kinyalolo's Generalization'). Thus the Degema SVC conspiracy can be localized to the syntax-prosody interface, and there is no need to adopt a unified postsyntactic morphology-prosody module like Rolle's. We offer some further conceptual critiques of his model.},

How do we communicate about events we have experienced? Influential theories of language production assume that the formulation and articulation of a linguistic message is preceded by preverbal apprehension that captures core aspects of the event. Yet the nature of these preverbal event representations and the way they are mapped onto language are currently not well understood. Here, we review recent evidence on the link between event conceptualization and language, focusing on two core aspects of event representation: event roles and event boundaries. Empirical evidence in both domains shows that the cognitive representation of events aligns with the way these aspects of events are encoded in language, providing support for the presence of deep homologies between linguistic and cognitive event structure.},

Most studies of verb serialisation have been confined to single languages rather than looking at crosslinguistic patterns. This book provides the first in-depth account into the areal characteristics of multi-verb constructions (MVCs) in Eastern Indonesia. By collating published data and corpus data from 32 Austronesian and Papuan languages, it traces commonalities as well as differences in MVC use across the area. To this end, a sample of 2146 MVCs is analysed both from a grammatical and a semantic perspective. One of the main hypotheses is that the crucial driving force behind multi-verb construals is semantic interaction between the verbs, leading to four principal techniques of event formation: merging, staging, modification, and free juxtaposition. Combining semantic approaches with crosslinguistic data analysis, the book provides a new model of event interaction offering a fresh perspective on multi-verb constructions in Eastern Indonesia and beyond.},

Generalization are still difficult since most observations are anecdotal rather than systematic: as far as language structure is concerned, languages spoken in mountainous regions are traditionally often attributed a ``conservative'' or ``archaic'' character, preserving inherited traits and patterns that are lost elsewhere; the inaccessibility of the terrain and the resulting relative social isolation are commonly invoked to explain this situation. More recently, mountain languages have also been claimed to feature peaks in the distribution of some typological properties, whether due to sociogeographical factors or, more controversially, even direct influences of the environment: ejectives, grammatical encoding of elevational or topographic information, and overall high levels of structural complexity.},

It is proposed that this difference is strongly correlated to Aquilan being a dialect spoken in a mountainous valley, and therefore reflecting the ``lay of the land'' in its spatial lexicon. The paper offers an experimental study involving two groups of informants (group 1, age {$>$}70.0 years, N = 13; group 2, age {$<$}40.0 years, N = 10).

  abstract = {Recombining known primitive concepts into larger novel combinations is a quintessentially human cognitive capability. Whether large neural models in NLP acquire this ability while learning from data is an open question. In this paper, we look at this problem from the perspective of formal languages. We use deterministic finite-state transducers to make an unbounded number of datasets with controllable properties governing compositionality. By randomly sampling over many transducers, we explore which of their properties (number of states, alphabet size, number of transitions etc.) contribute to learnability of a compositional relation by a neural network. In general, we find that the models either learn the relations completely or not at all. The key is transition coverage, setting a soft learnability limit at 400 examples per transition.},

This has resulted in highly diverse language varieties \textemdash{} often with little or no mutual intelligibility \textemdash{} falling under a single label despite these considerable linguistic and sometimes cultural differences. Likewise, varieties which are closely related or lacking any meaningful differences may be classified as distinct entities, such as with the Phong variety which is classified as either Tangsa or as Nocte depending on the district in which the speaker resides. Based on an analysis of sound correspondences and lexical variation between varieties, this paper argues the case for treatment of TangsaNocte not as two closely related branches within the Sal languages, as earlier classifications may suggest, but rather as a single dialect continuum. Furthermore, some diagnostic tests are provided in order to help determine placement of newly documented varieties within the larger group.},

Prosodic cues, such as pitch accents, can build expectations about upcoming sentence elements. This study investigates to what extent syntactic and semantic expectations generated by pitch accents can be dissociated and if so, which cues take precedence when contradictory information is present. We used sentences in which one out of two nominal constituents was placed in contrastive focus with a third one. All noun phrases carried overt syntactic information (case-marking of the determiner) and semantic information (typicality of the thematic role of the noun). Two experiments (a sentence comprehension and a sentence completion task) show that focus, marked by pitch accents, established expectations in both syntactic and semantic domains. However, only the syntactic expectations, when violated, were strong enough to interfere with sentence comprehension. Furthermore, when contradictory cues occurred in the same sentence, the local syntactic cue (case-marking) took precedence over the semantic cue (thematic role), and overwrote previous information cued by prosody. The findings indicate that during auditory sentence comprehension the processing system integrates different sources of information for argument role assignment, yet primarily relies on syntactic information.},

  abstract = {The Bantu languages are in some sense remarkably uniform (subject, verb, order (SVO) basic word order, noun classes, verbal morphology), but this extensive language family also show a wealth of morphosyntactic variation. Two core areas in which such variation is attested are subject and object agreement. The book explores the variation in Bantu subject and object marking on the basis of data from 75 Bantu languages, discovering striking patterns (the Relation between Asymmetry and Non-Doubling Object Marking (RANDOM), and the Asymmetry Wants Single Object Marking (AWSOM) correlation), and providing a novel syntactic analysis. This analysis takes into account not just phi agreement, but also nominal licensing and information structure. A Person feature, associated with animacy, definiteness, or givenness, is shown to be responsible for differential object agreement, while at the same time accounting for doubling vs. non-doubling object marking\textemdash a hybrid solution to an age-old debate in Bantu comparative morphosyntax. It is furthermore proposed that low functional heads can Case-license flexibly downwards or upwards, depending on the relative topicality of the two arguments involved. This accounts for the properties of symmetric object marking in ditransitives (for Appl), and subject inversion constructions (for v). By keeping Agree constant and systematically determining which featural parameters are responsible for the attested variation, the proposed analysis argues for an emergentist view of features and parameters (following Biberauer 2018, 2019), and against both Strong Uniformity and Strong Modularity.},

After a brief general introduction to the functional typology of property words, I first discuss diversity in Oceanic property word classes from a family-internal perspective. In the second part of the paper, Oceanic property words are placed in a world-wide typological perspective. Specifically, I test their behavior with regard to two implicational universals proposed in the literature, concerning the relation between the encoding of predicative property words, the presence of grammatical tense, and locus of marking at the clause level. In typological studies, the Oceanic language family has been claimed to display verbal predicative property words, to lack tense, and to be head- or zero-marking, with marginal exceptions. This paper shows that, even though such an overall profile can be discerned, Oceanic property words exhibit more variation than is acknowledged in crosslinguistic research. Moreover, my findings for property word classes are fitted into a larger picture of lexical categorization in Oceanic languages.},

  abstract = {Van Oest (2019) developed a framework to assess interrater agreement for nominal categories and complete data. We generalize this framework to all four situations of nominal or ordinal categories and complete or incomplete data. The mathematical solution yields a chancecorrected agreement coefficient that accommodates any weighting scheme for penalizing rater disagreements and any number of raters and categories. By incorporating Bayesian estimates of the category proportions, the generalized coefficient also captures situations in which raters classify only subsets of items; that is, incomplete data. Furthermore, this coefficient encompasses existing chance-corrected agreement coefficients: the S -coefficient, Scott's pi, Fleiss' kappa, and Van Oest's uniform prior coefficient, all augmented with a weighting scheme and the option of incomplete data. We use simulation to compare these nested coefficients. The uniform prior coefficient tends to perform best, in particular, if one category has a much larger proportion than others. The gap with Scott's pi and Fleiss' kappa widens if the weighting scheme becomes more lenient to small disagreements and often if more item classifications are missing; missingness biases play a moderating role. The uniform prior coefficient usually performs much better than the S -coefficient, but the S -coefficient sometimes performs best for small samples, missing data, and lenient weighting schemes. The generalized framework implies a new interpretation of chance-corrected weighted agreement coefficients: These coefficients estimate the probability that both raters in a pair assign an item to its correct category without guessing. Whereas Van Oest showed this interpretation for unweighted agreement, we generalize to weighted agreement.},

Carefully distinguishing between two senses of information structure e the relational and the referential e we show that the interplay of prosody and specificational clause, reversed and non-reversed, is far from random. In the majority of non-reversed clauses, we found that the value and variable were realised in different tone units. Thus, claims that the value will receive the focal accent were found to be overly simplistic. Instead, where the variable and value were realised across different tone units the prosodic choice was motivated by the variable's discourse status and relative unpredictability. Rising tones presented the value as non-exhaustive, allowing for multiple values for a single variable. This re-enforced the projected lack of epistemic certainty. As expected, reversed specificationals were found to be produced mostly as single tone units; contrary to expectation, their focal accent was often on the variable. This, we noted, was likely due to the high incidence of demonstrative values in subject position. To conclude, our innovative approach demonstrates the importance of examining the interplay between syntax, discourse and prosody in explicating the meaning potential of constructions such as specificational clauses.},

Pictures of women clad in ritual beadwork against the backdrop of their art on homestead walls have spread since the 1950s. Some of them, like Esther Mahlangu, rose to fame as an individual mural artist. It will be illustrated how this bodily image of the Ndebele woman emerged from a small village north of Pretoria. Evidence will show how the Ndebele tourism body became completely estranged from the ritual bodily context. Following on this, it will be explained how Ndebele women use ritual to raise their statuses within the domain of a male dominated society. It will be contended that these women were not merely passive victims of marginalization but they have become powerful agents to manipulate and advance their own destinies. Arguments have been informed by discourses on the anthropology of the body, the efficacy and power of ritual, the notion of identity, ideas on commoditization and the anthropology of tourism.},

Our large-scale analyses, encompassing half a million scholars, revealed that female scholars' work is mentioned less frequently than male scholars' work in all research areas. When exploring the characteristics associated with online success, we found that the impact of prior work, social capital, and gendered tie formation in coauthorship networks are linked with online success for men, but not for women\textemdash even in the areas with the highest female representation. These results suggest that while men's scientific impact and collaboration networks are associated with higher visibility online, there are no universally identifiable facets associated with success for women. Our comprehensive empirical evidence indicates that the gender gap in online science dissemination is coupled with a lack of understanding the characteristics that are linked with female scholars' success, which might hinder efforts to close the gender gap in visibility.},

The process of assigning language names is not neutral, trivial or objective: it is a highly political process driven and shaped by understandings of group identity, similarity and difference. Closer attention to local perspectives on language naming offers important insights into ideologies around social and linguistic differentiation. This paper draws together accounts of diverse language naming practices from across Indigenous Australia and applies a close lens to the region of western Arnhem Land. Through an examination of three groups (speakers of Bininj Kunwok, Mawng, and Burarra), we describe the range of strategies speakers use to divide up their local language ecologies, practices for naming lects, and the role of variation in the processes of differentiation. Naming practices between these groups show interesting similarities but also striking differences. We further highlight the interplay between two key processes which characterise local language naming strategies in the region: the `erasure' of difference, typically from the perspective of a politically more powerful group, and the intentional creation of linguistic differentiation, or ausbau.},

Three quarters of the languages have tense: the majority partition the timeline into three sections: before, during and after the deictic centre (effectively past, present and future tense). Those languages with only two tenses most commonly have future/nonfuture tense. Interestingly, a group of languages have only one tense, the majority of them the future. This might indicate that there is a stronger motivation for the future tense to grammaticalize than for other tenses, mirroring a real/unreal world divide: real world events are easier to characterize through aspect than events that are yet to happen, which might create a need for a device that locates an event in future time.},

Surprisal and entropy reduction have been independently proposed as linking theories between word processing difficulty and probabilistic language models. Extant models, however, are typically limited to capturing linguistic experience and hence cannot account for the influence of world knowledge. A recent comprehension model by Venhuizen, Crocker, and Brouwer (2019, Discourse Processes) improves upon this situation by instantiating a comprehension-centric metric of surprisal that integrates linguistic experience and world knowledge at the level of interpretation and combines them in determining online expectations. Here, we extend this work by deriving a comprehension-centric metric of entropy reduction from this model. In contrast to previous work, which has found that surprisal and entropy reduction are not easily dissociated, we do find a clear dissociation in our model. While both surprisal and entropy reduction derive from the same cognitive process\textemdash the word-by-word updating of the unfolding interpretation\textemdash they reflect different aspects of this process: state-by-state expectation (surprisal) versus end-state confirmation (entropy reduction).},

  abstract = {Ekphrasis is a sub-genre of poetry addressing existent or imaginary works of art. Though now a term in poetics, its cultural roots go back to classical rhetoric, which shows that the two have always been in an osmotic relationship. In a wider context, ekphrasis is also the natural outcome of the traditionally strong bond in Western art between poetry and the visual arts, which Aristotle regarded as imitative arts because both make use of mimetic representation. This close link found its fullest expression in Horace's famous simile Ut pictura poesis. Different periods of Western art history had different ekphrastic agendas, ranging from Homer's description of the making of the shield of Achilles in the Iliad to Auden's `Mus\'ee des Beaux Arts' on some pictures by Pieter Brueghel the Elder. Auden may have set the fashion, but as it happened this 16th-century Flemish painter became the favourite muse of a great many other 20thcentury poets, in both Europe and the USA. As an illustration of this genre, I present a reading of William Carlos Williams's ekphrastic poem `The Dance', which was inspired by Brueghel's picture `The Kermess'. In my analysis I combine the tools of stylistics with those of cognitive poetics, which has embraced the cognitive linguistic theory that any act of language use can potentially be related to some underpinning mental faculty, for example, experience, memory, perception, imagination, and emotion. Along these lines, I try to show how my analysis and reading of the poem's rhetorical elements, or perceived effects, might be traced to certain underlying cognitive structures such as mentally stored real-world experience, memories and images, genre knowledge, the human delight in repetitive formal patterns, the embodied experience of movement, spatial perception, figure\textendash ground alignments in visual and other sensory perceptions, etc.},

In this article, we bring attention to variation as a source of information. Instead of discarding variation as mere noise, we examine what it can reveal about the representation and use of linguistic knowledge. By means of metalinguistic judgment data, we demonstrate how to quantify and interpret four types of variation: variation across items, participants, time, and methods. The data concern familiarity ratings assigned by 91 native speakers of Dutch to 79 Dutch prepositional phrases such as in de tuin `in the garden' and rond de ingang `around the entrance'. Participants performed the judgment task twice within a period of one to two weeks, using either a 7-point Likert scale or a Magnitude Estimation scale. We explicate the principles according to which the different types of variation can be considered information about mental representation, and we show how they can be used to test hypotheses regarding linguistic representations.},

In recent decades, great advances have been made in the description and study of these syntactic constructions from languages spoken around the world (Talmy 1985, 1991, Slobin 1996, 2004). However, relatively little attention has been paid to historical change in these systems (exceptions are Vincent 1999, Dufresne, Dupuis \& Tremblay 2003, Kopecka 2006 and Peyraube 2006). In this article, diachronic change of motion event encoding systems in Indo-European is investigated using the available historical\textendash comparative data and phylogenetic comparative methods adopted from evolutionary biology. It is argued that Proto-Indo-European was not satellite-framed, as suggested by Talmy (2007) and Acedo Matell\'an and Mateu (2008), but had a mixed motion event encoding system, as is suggested by the available historical\textendash comparative data.},

Comparisons between satellite-framed and verb-framed languages suggest that satellite-framed languages typically have a larger manner of motion verb lexicon (swim, dash), while verb-framed languages typically have a larger path of motion verb lexicon (enter, cross) (Slobin 2004, Verkerk 2013, 2014b). This paper investigates how differences between the motion verb lexicons of satellite-framed and verb-framed languages emerge. Phylogenetic comparative methods adopted from biology and an etymological study are used to investigate manner verb lexicons and path verb lexicons in an Indo-European dataset. I show that manner verbs and path verbs typically have different types of etymological origins and that manner verbs emerge faster in satellite-framed subgroups, while path verbs emerge faster in verb-framed subgroups.},

Our results show that laughter is much more frequent than has been described previously by self-report studies. Contrary to the common view that laughter is elicited by external stimuli, participants frequently laughed after their own verbal utterances. We thus suggest that laughter in conversation may primarily serve to regulate the flow of interaction and to mitigate the meaning of the preceding utterance. Conversational laughter bouts consisted of a smaller number of laughter elements and had longer interval durations than laughter bouts elicited by media. These parameters also varied with conversational context. The high intraindividual variability in the acoustic parameters of laughter, which greatly exceeded the parameter variability between subjects, may thus be a result of the laughter context.},

We suggest here that this verbal complex can be treated as a case of asymmetrical verbal serialization because it contains verbs from a major lexical class, occupying the V1 slot, followed by a more restricted intransitive verbal class, such as movement, postural, or stative verbs, which stands in the V2 position. The curious property of these constructions is that V2 can be transitivized through the attachment of applicative or causative morphemes and ``share'' its object with transitive V1. ``Object sharing'' is another property attributed to serialization, as suggested by Baker and Baker and Stewart, which may be seen as a strong argument in favor of the present hypothesis. We will also provide evidence to distinguish Mbya Guarani V1-V2 (Cy/vy) complex from other constructions, such as temporal and purpose subordinate clauses, involving the particle vy.},

The PWG is shown to play a role in the phonology of compound-like expressions in a great number of languages, belonging to different linguistic families. Evidence is multifarious, coming from segmental, tonal, duration and prominence related phenomena. Crucially, evidence is also offered against an analysis resorting to recursive prosodic words \textendash{} e.g., prominence patterns at the levels of the Prosodic Word (PW) and PWG may be reversed; phonological phenomena distinguishing the two domains show a difference in kind and not just in strength (Ladd 1996/2008; Frota 2000).},

  abstract = {Our understanding of the cognitive and neural underpinnings of language has traditionally been firmly based on spoken Indo-European languages and on language studied as speech or text. However, in face-to-face communication, language is multimodal: speech signals are invariably accompanied by visual information on the face and in manual gestures, and sign languages deploy multiple channels (hands, face and body) in utterance construction. Moreover, the narrow focus on spoken Indo-European languages has entrenched the assumption that language is comprised wholly by an arbitrary system of symbols and rules. However, iconicity (i.e. resemblance between aspects of communicative form and meaning) is also present: speakers use iconic gestures when they speak; many non-Indo-European spoken languages exhibit a substantial amount of iconicity in word forms and, finally, iconicity is the norm, rather than the exception in sign languages. This introduction provides the motivation for taking a multimodal approach to the study of language learning, processing and evolution, and discusses the broad implications of shifting our current dominant approaches and assumptions to encompass multimodal expression in both signed and spoken languages.},

ToBI is an acronym for Tones and Breaks Indices which first denoted an intonation system developed in the 1990s for annotating intonation and prosody in the database of spoken Mainstream American English. The MAE\_ToBI transcription originally consists of six parts \textendash{} the audio recording of the utterance, the fundamental frequency contour and four parallel tiers for the transcription of tone sequence, ortographic transcription, indication of break indices between words and for additional observations. The core of the transcription, i. e. of the phonological analyses of the intonation pattern, is represented by the tone tier where tonal variation is transcribed by using labels for high tone and low tone where a tone can appear as a pitch accent, phrase accent and boundary tone. Due to its simplicity and flexibility, the system soon began to be used for the prosodic annotation of other variants of English and many other languages, as well as in different non-linguistic fields, leading to the creation of many new ToBI systems adapted to individual languages and dialects. The author is the first to use this method for Slovene, more precisely, for the intonational transcription and analysis of the corpus of spontaneous speech of Slovene Istria, in order to investigate if the ToBi system is useful for the annotation of Slovene and its regional variants.},

This typological contrast is too narrow as it stands, however, to account for the diversity found both within and across types. The present study is based on what can be termed a               process-oriented perspective               . It includes the analyses of all relevant conceptual domains notably the domain of temporality, in addition to space, and thus goes beyond previous studies. The languages studied differ typologically as follows:               path               is typically expressed in the verb in French and Tunisian Arabic in contrast to               manner of motion               in English and German, while in the temporal domain               aspect               is expressed grammatically in English and Tunisian Arabic but not in German and French. The study compares the representations which speakers construct when forming a reportable event as a response to video clips showing a series of naturalistic scenes in which an entity moves through space. The analysis includes the following conceptual categories: (1) the privileged event               layer               (manner vs. path) which drives the selection of breakpoints in the formation of event units when processing the visual input; (2) the privileged category in spatial framing (figure-based/ground-based) and (3) viewpoint aspect (phasal decomposition or not). We assume that each of these three cognitive categories is shaped specifically by language structure (both system and repertoire) and language use (frequency of constructions). The findings reveal systematic differences both across, as well as within, typologically related languages with respect to (1) the basic event type encoded, (2) the changes in quality expressed, (3) the total number of path segments encoded per situation, and (4) the number of path segments packaged into one utterance. The findings reveal what can be termed language-specific default settings along each of the conceptual dimensions and their interrelations which function as               language specific attentional templates               .},

The syntactic and semantic functional dimensions (speech act, constituency, focus) are orthogonal to each other, but to which extent their prosodic correlates are remains controversial. This paper reports on a production experiment that crosses these three dimensions to look for interactions, concentrating on interactions between focus prominence and phrasing. The results provide evidence that interactions are more limited than many current theories of sentence prosody would predict, and support a theory that keeps different prosodic dimensions representationally separate.},

English speakers, for example, tend to perceive alternating short and long sounds as a series of binary groups with a final beat (iambs), and alternating soft and loud sounds as a series of trochees. This generalization, often called the `Iambictrochaic Law' (ITL), although viewed as an auditory universal by some, has been argued to be shaped by language experience. Earlier work on the ITL had a crucial limitation, in that it did not tease apart the percepts of grouping and prominence, which the notions of iamb and trochee inherently confound. We explore how intensity and duration relate to percepts of prominence and grouping in six languages (English, French, German, Japanese, Mandarin, and Spanish). The results show that the ITL is not universal, and that cue interpretation is shaped by language experience. However, there are also invariances: Duration appears relatively robust across languages as a cue to prominence (longer syllables are perceived as stressed), and intensity for grouping (louder syllables are perceived as initial). The results show the beginnings of a rhythmic typology based on how the dimensions of grouping and prominence are cued.},

First, a set of selectives in 81 languages from all continents is compiled on the basis of their occurrence with emphatic personal pronouns in contrast constructions. In a second step, it is explored how this set of markers is used across 19 subordinate clause domains. The results indicate that, despite much crosslinguistic diversity, the distribution of selectives across subordinate clauses is strongly constrained. Selectives in subordinate clauses are distributed following a tendency scale (no strict hierarchy, but no blatant exceptions): general relative clauses rank highest followed by conditional and temporal clauses with concessive and purpose clauses ranking lowest. No postposed subordinate clauses attract selectives. It is further found that selectives tend to occur at the end of the constituent which they have scope over where there is minimal risk of scope ambiguity. Despite the frequent occurrence of selectives on conditional clauses, selectives tend not to be conditional connectives unless this happens to be their grammaticalization source.},

Participants were put into one of three conditions, where they either read good facts about Australia, bad facts about Australia, or no facts about Australia (the control). Participants performed the same listening task \textendash{} matching the vowel in a sentence to a vowel in a synthesized continuum \textendash{} before and after reading the facts. The results indicate that participants who read the bad facts shifted their perception of KIT to more Australianlike tokens relative to the control group, while the participants who read good facts shifted their perception of KIT to more NZ-like tokens relative to the control group. This result shows that perceptual adaptation towards a dialect can occur in the absence of a speaker of that dialect and that these adaptations are subject to a listener's (manipulated) affect towards the primed dialect region.},

The remaining speakers are elders who maintain it only through linguistic memory, where elements of the language are remembered and can be elicited but they are not actively used in regular conversation. Reo Rapa, a contact language that fuses Tahitian and Old Rapa, which has developed from the prolonged and dominant influence of the Tahitian language in Rapa Iti since the mid nineteenth century, has replaced the indigenous Old Rapa language at home and between most people in regular social interaction. This article analyzes Reo Rapa through an examination of its genesis and its structure. This article furthermore defines Reo Rapa as a unique contact variety, a shift-break language: a language that resulted from stalled shift due to a collective anti-convergence sentiment in the speech community. This \-article further discusses a variety of Reo Rapa speech, New Rapa, which presents important questions for the natural-ness of language change and the visibility of actuation.},

Segmental phonology includes segments of speech including consonants and vowels and how they make up syllables. Suprasegmental features include register tone system and stress. We examine how syllable weight or moraicity plays a determining role in the placement of stress, a major criterion for phonological word in Brokpa; we also look at some other evidence for phonological words in this language. We argue that synchronic segmental and suprasegmental features of Brokpa provide evidence in favour of a number of innovative processes in this archaic Bodish language. We conclude that Brokpa, a language historically rich in consonant clusters with a simple vowel system and a relatively simple prosodic system, is losing its consonant clusters and developing additional complexities including lexical tones.},

It is found that, in all three dialects, focus is encoded by increasing the maximum F0 and duration of focused words, and lowering and compressing the F0 and pitch range of post-focus words. These results are consistent with previous findings about Wu dialect in Shanghai. Northern Wu dialects therefore seem to encode focus in a similar way to Beijing Mandarin, but different from many languages/dialects spoken in southern China. This finding, together with evidence from gene studies and migration history of Wu areas, provide further support for the inheritance hypothesis of PFC, according to which all languages with PFC are descendants of a common proto-language in the Middle East.},

This inter-speaker variation is reflected in the different transcriptions of Kaifeng L that have been given in the literature. We argue that a L-tone is intrinsically less salient than a H-tone, due to a lack of phonetic space in the low pitch range as well as to a potential ambiguity between contextual low pitch around f0 peaks and low pitch due to L-tones, and thus more likely to be enhanced.},

Watson \& Gibson (2004a) proposed that the likelihood of an intonational boundary at a word boundary is a function of 1) the size of the most recently completed constituent and 2) the size of the upcoming constituent if it is not an argument of the most recent head. We explore an alternate hypothesis to (1): the distance of integration between an upcoming word and its attachment site in the sentence influences the likelihood of an intonational boundary. In a production experiment (Experiment 1), we found that speakers\~O intonational phrasing patterns were consistent with Watson \& Gibson's original hypothesis. We then present two studies of sentence comprehension using converging paradigms which test the hypothesis that listeners exploit the relationship between syntax and the production-based intonational boundaries by using a special parsing heuristic. In particular, we propose that listeners prefer not to attach incoming words to lexical heads that are followed by an intonational boundary. This hypothesis is validated in both Experiments 2 and 3.},

A strong focus for this debate has been a well-documented difference in early word learning: Infants' success in learning verbs lags behind their success in learning nouns. In this review, we articulate both sides of the debate and summarize new cross-linguistic evidence from infants that underscores the role of universal features and begins to clarify the impact of distinctly different languages on early language and conceptual development.},

The pronoun this, referring to the complete sense of a preceding sentence or clause, cannot always carry the load and so may produce an imprecise statement.''), it is nevertheless very common in written text. Handling this usage poses a problem for Natural Language Understanding systems. The solution I propose is based on distinguishing between what can be pointed to and what can be referred to by virtue of pointing. I argue that a restricted set of discourse segments yield what such demonstrative pronouns can point to and a restricted set of what Nunberg (1979) has called referring functions yield what they can refer to by virtue of that pointing.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have revealed that infants aged 6\textendash 10 months are able to use the acoustic correlates of major prosodic boundaries, that is, pitch change, preboundary lengthening, and pause, for the segmentation of the continuous speech signal. Moreover, investigations with American-English- and Dutch-learning infants suggest that processing prosodic boundary markings involves a weighting of these cues. This weighting seems to develop with increasing exposure to the native language and to underlie crosslinguistic variation. In the following, we report the results of four experiments using the headturn preference procedure to explore the perception of prosodic boundary cues in German infants. We presented 8-month-old infants with a sequence of names in two different prosodic groupings, with or without boundary markers. Infants discriminated both sequences when the boundary was marked by all three cues (Experiment 1) and when it was marked by a pitch change and preboundary lengthening in combination (Experiment 2). The presence of a pitch change (Experiment 3) or preboundary lengthening (Experiment 4) as single cues did not lead to a successful discrimination. Our results indicate that pause is not a necessary cue for German infants. Pitch change and preboundary lengthening in combination, but not as single cues, are sufficient. Hence, by 8 months infants only rely on a convergence of boundary markers. Comparisons with adults' performance on the same stimulus materials suggest that the pattern observed with the 8-month-olds is already consistent with that of adults. We discuss our findings with respect to crosslinguistic variation and the development of a language-specific prosodic cue weighting.},

In this survey, phonetic aspects (here called `categories') that are typically reported were assessed in three English-language collections \textendash{} the Illustrations of the IPA from the               Journal of the International Phonetic Association               , articles from the               Journal of Phonetics               , and papers from the Ladefoged/Maddieson Sounds of the World's Languages (SOWL) documentation project. Categories were defined for consonants (e.g. Voice Onset Time (VOT) and frication spectrum; 10 in total), vowels (e.g. formants and duration; 7 in total) and suprasegmentals (e.g. stress and distinctive vowel length, 6 in total). The Illustrations, due to their brevity, had, on average, limited coverage of the selected categories (12\% of the 23 categories).               Journal of Phonetics               articles were typically theoretically motivated, but 64 had sufficient measurements to count as phonetic documentation; these also covered 12\% of the categories. The SOWL studies, designed to cover as much of the phonetic structure as feasible in an article-length treatment, achieved 41\% coverage on average. Four book-length studies were also examined, with an average of 49\% coverage. Phonetic properties of many language families have been studied, though Indo-European is still disproportionately represented. Physiological measures were excluded as being less common, and perceptual measures were excluded as being typically more theoretical. This preliminary study indicates that certain acoustic properties of languages are typically measured and may be considered as an impetus for later, fuller coverage, but broader consensus on the categories is needed. Current and future documentation efforts would benefit these considerations being addressed.},

Latencies for the sentence [Ik zoek het] [water] `I seek the water' were shorter than latencies for sentences like [Ik zoek] [vers] [water] `I seek fresh water'. We extend this research by examining the prepared production of utterances containing phonological words that are less than a lexical word in length. Dutch compounds (e.g. ooglid `eyelid') form a single morphosyntactic word and a phonological word, which in turn includes two phonological words. We compare their prepared production latencies to those syntactic phrases consisting of an adjective and a noun (e.g. oud lid `old member') which comprise two morphosyntactic and two phonological words, and to morphologically simple words (e.g. orgel `organ') which comprise one morphosyntactic and one phonological word. Our findings demonstrate that the effect is limited to phrasal level phonological words, suggesting that production models need to make a distinction between lexical and phrasal phonology.},

Final-syllable vowel lengthening is proposed to be a language-universal cue to word segmentation, but cross-linguistic investigations of the perception of initial consonant lengthening are lacking. We compared the use of word-initial consonant lengthening and word-final vowel lengthening by native speakers of English, Hungarian and Italian, using an artificial language learning task and varying vowel and consonant durations between subjects within each language group. Wordfinal vowel lengthening was only exploited for segmentation by English speakers; we interpret its nonuniversality as potentially due, at least in part, to language-specific functional loads on vowel duration, used for indicating lexical stress in Italian and vowel identity in Hungarian. By contrast, all three language groups used word-initial consonant lengthening to locate word boundaries, but did not benefit from lengthening of vowels in word-initial syllables. If domain-initial consonant timing effects are universal, it may be because they promote two related but separable processing requirements for the listener: (a) word segmentation, boosted by lengthening across the boundary; (b) lexical access, boosted by articulatory strengthening and lengthening of word onsets.},

  abstract = {This thesis presents the morphology and much of the syntax of Menya, which is a Papuan language spoken in the Morobe Province of Papua New Guinea. It is the second most populous of at least twelve languages that constitute the Angan language family, which is, in turn, considered to be a stock-level isolate of the Trans-New Guinea Phylum. With the possible exception of a pedagogical grammar of Kapau, published in 1968, this is the most comprehensive grammar of an Angan language to become readily available to the linguistic world. The grammar is written from a functional and typological perspective and describes the form and function of structures at and below the sentence level. It is based on the analysis of various genre of texts (both oral and written), from which most of the examples are extracted, and includes discourse and pragmatic considerations in explaining the meaning and function of the structures described. The data on which the grammar is based has been gathered during numerous periods of residence in the Menya village of Akwanja since 1975. The main complexities of Menya grammar are in its pronouns, its irrealis modalities and its clause-combining strategies. Whereas the personal pronouns are relatively simple, the demonstrative pronouns are based on seven deictic roots, are inflected for gender, number and person, and are used both as free pronouns and as NP specifiers. There are also dyadic pronouns that refer to specific kin combinations. Most multi-propositional sentences involve the use of distinct (medial) verb forms which agree in person and number with the clause actor, indicate the (dis)continuity of the topical entity via a switch-reference system, and encode various aspects of the relationship that holds between clauses. There are coordinate medial forms distinct from those used in the clause chaining system that is typical of Papuan languages.},

While some emotions may have direct correlates in a speaker's voice, such correlates are harder to find for attitudinal meanings.                            The word               please               is typically a routine expression of courtesy, but data from the International Corpus of British English (ICE GB) reveals               please               to be a pragmatic marker with a wide range of expressive functions. This study, which uses a quantitative approach combined with qualitative analysis, has implications for the study of other pragmatic particles, and also provides the basis for the understanding of attitudinal intonation in a wider context.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a basic classification of 737 Papuan doculects pertaining to 513 different ISO 639-3 codes, in addition to 9 doculects that have not been assigned ISO 639-3 codes. Ethnologue (Lewis 2009) catalogues 848 non-Austronesian languages of New Guinea. Thus, this paper covers 60\% of these languages. The point of the paper is to provide a solid benchmark for the classification of languages in a region which is clearly the most poorly understood in the world. The classification combines two different proposals, one of which is the classification by Harald Hammarstr\"om (2010), augmented by personal correspondence (2012), and the other is a classification based on methods of the Automated Similarity Judgment Program (ASJP). The former represents a conservative sifting of published evidence for language family affiliations and the latter provides an automated classification based on similarity among 40 lexical items selected for maximal stability. An ASJP tree annotated for Hammarstr\"om's families allows for identifying cases where the latter apparently fail to be coherent and should therefore possibly be broken up into smaller units, as well as cases where families should possibly be merged. The resulting classification will be even more conservative than Hammarstr\"om's in many cases, but it will also contain proposals for wider relationships not considered supported by Hammarstr\"om, including several proposals that have not been made before in the literature.},

It is observable in the matching of facial expression, posture and body movements.  It can also be observed in speech prosody, including accommodation of tempo, loudness and pitch. Accommodation, or convergence, is not yet well understood: some aspects appear to be an automatic response, but is also thought to be at least in part socially motivated.  This paper deals with accommodation in speech prosody, and focuses on the role played by accommodation of pitch in the generation of socio-pragmatic meaning, which can include the potential to reflect a degree of compliance, rapport or empathy with the interlocutor. Conveying compliance or lack of compliance is of particular importance in situations of conflict, and several studies are reported that highlight the strategic importance of vocal behaviour in controlling, minimising or escalating interpersonal conflict. The findings suggest that prosodic behaviour reflects the essentially co-operative nature of human communication and can be exploited as a social strategy. Furthermore, they suggest that attitudinal meaning is conveyed not only by the prosody of an individual utterance but by the sequential relationships between utterances.},

Different quantitative performance evaluations all point to a relatively poor overall performance in the case of Austronesian. In order to investigate why Austronesian appears to be so recalcitrant, we identify the individual Austronesian language groups that are responsible for the discrepancies between ASJP and expert classifications\textemdash the `black sheep' of the family\textemdash using a simple technique called jackknifing. There are hundreds of languages which induce a poor fit between expert and ASJP classification. It turns out that many of these languages belong to subgroups of Austronesian that are actually not well-established through shared innovations. Thus, inaccuracies in the experts' classification of Austronesian must, at least partly, be responsible for the added amount of error in the ASJP classification when it comes to Austronesian.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel perspective on the complex structure of predicate signs, addressing the mapping between semantic components of events and their overt morphophonological representations in ASL (the Event Visibility Hypothesis), and suggests that fundamental similarities across SLs may be related to these structural pieces. Predicate sign structure is compositional in ways that have not been previously identified, and their components are grammaticalized from universally available physics of motion and geometry of space. The semantic concepts involved here are individual, event (states and processes), location, duration, termination, and completion. The relevant characteristics from geometry are point, line, plane and from physics distance, duration, velocity, and acceleration/deceleration. With the principled exception of classifier predicates (CLP) and spatial `tracing' movements, phonological path movement of predicate signs maps to semantic Extent (duration) of an event and movement which stops at points in space maps semantically to the final State of telic events and its individual argument. Thus, like CLP, agreeing verbs are multimorphemic. These resources provide an explanation for the apparent visual similarity of SLs to each other, even while they remain mutually unintelligible.},

We evaluate a model's acquisition of island constraints by demonstrating that its expectation for a filler\textemdash gap contingency is attenuated within an island environment. Our results provide empirical evidence against the Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus for this particular structure.},

  abstract = {In studies of cumulative cultural evolution in non-human animals, the focus is most often on incremental changes that increase the efficacy of an existing form of socially learned behaviour, such as the refinement of migratory pathways. In this paper, we compare the songs of different species to describe patterns of evolution in the acoustic structure of bird songs, and explore the question of what building blocks might underlie cumulative cultural evolution of bird song using a comparative approach. We suggest that three steps occurred: first, imitation of independent sounds, or notes, via social learning; second, the formation of categories of note types; and third, assembling note types into sequences with defined structures. Simple sequences can then be repeated to form simple songs or concatenated with other sequences to form segmented songs, increasing complexity. Variant forms of both the notes and the sequencing rules may then arise due to copy errors and innovation. Some variants may become established in the population because of learning biases or selection, increasing signal efficiency, or because of cultural drift. Cumulative cultural evolution of bird songs thus arises from cognitive processes such as vocal imitation, categorization during memorization and learning biases applied to basic acoustic building blocks.

The historical dialectological study of English has largely grown out of the linguistic study of texts belonging to the Middle English period, but also separate historical dialectological methods have been developed in the study of Old English (Kitson 1993, 1995), Old French (Dees et al. 1980; Dees et al. 1987) and Middle Dutch (Mooijaart 1992) and 13th- to 15th-century South-West German (Kleiber et al. 1979). I will exemplify mostly from Middle English materials in the discussions that follow, but will also refer to the principles and methodologies as applied to other medieval vernaculars. In any case, principles and methodologies need not be language-specific and techniques of description and analysis might be applied and tested with profit against data from languages other than those for which they were originally created. Indeed, traversing language borders to test principles and methodologies further is an obvious desideratum for the development of historical dialectology as a productive field of linguistic enquiry.},

Sources that come from direct evidence and general knowledge are indicated through the choice of verb. The former is indicated with an equational verb and the latter is indicated with an existential verb. Information that is inferred is indicated in two possible ways. Either a bare verb stem is followed by a grammaticalised form of the existential, or a future form of the verb is followed with the grammaticalised form of the existential. The reported evidential is a clause final particle that is grammaticalised from the lexical verb `to say/call'. Indicating information source is not obligatory in Darma. The examples illustrating evidentiality in Darma are from a corpus of natural discourse.},

Across psychology, use of the terms analytic and non-analytic imply that Differentiation Theory is correct\textemdash if cognition begins with the attributes, then synthesis, rather than analysis, is the more appropriate chemical analogy. We re-examined four classic studies of the effects of time pressure, incidental training, and concurrent load on classification and category learning (Kemler Nelson, 1984; Smith \& Kemler Nelson, 1984; Smith \& Shapiro, 1989; Ward, 1983). These studies are typically interpreted as supporting Differentiation Theory over Combination Theory, while more recent work in classification (Milton et al., 2008, et seq.) supports the opposite conclusion. Across seven experiments, replication and re-analysis of the four classic studies revealed that they do not support Differentiation Theory over Combination Theory\textemdash two experiments support Combination Theory over Differentiation Theory, and the remainder are compatible with both accounts. We conclude that Combination Theory provides a parsimonious account of both classic and more recent work in this area. The presented data do not require Differentiation Theory, nor a Combination\textendash Differentiation hybrid account.},

It also appears to be a locus of language change, with young people extending elision to new contexts; resulting in a distinctive style of speech which speakers refer to as mutumutu (`short' speech). This study examines the productions of utterance-final past tense suffixes /-nu, -\"iu, -Nu/ by four older and four younger Pitjantjatjara speakers in spontaneous speech. This is a context where elision tends not to be sociolinguistically or perceptually salient. We find extensive variance within and between speakers in the realization of both the vowel and nasal segments. We also find evidence of a change in progress, with a mixed effects model showing that among the older speakers, elision is associated with both the place of articulation of the nasal segment and the metrical structure of the verbal stem, while among the younger speakers, elision is associated with place of articulation but metrical structure plays little role. This is in line with a reanalysis of the conditions for elision by younger speakers based on the variability present in the speech of older people. Such a reanalysis would also account for many of the sociolinguistically marked extended contexts of elision.},

However, recent research shows that apparently complex inflectional paradigms can be organised in such a way that knowing one inflected form of a lexeme greatly reduces the uncertainty of other forms (e.g. Ackerman and Malouf 2013). Further typological work is required to investigate the ways in which inflectional interpredictability is achieved, and what aspects of wordforms may be informative. In this paper we present a case study of interpredictability in verbal inflection in Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara (PamaNyungan; Australia). We show that a combination of suffix allomorphy, prosodically conditioned stem augmentation, and the prosodic structure of verbal roots all conspire to achieve a paradigm that is totally interpredictable: hearing one inflected verb enables a speaker to produce with certainty any other form of that verb. We also provide a detailed description of metrical structure in the language, clarifying previous analyses.},

  abstract = {The impersonal experiencer construction is well known among the Papuan languages of New Guinea, regularly appearing in typological descriptions (Foley 1986; Foley 2000). This has two regular features: an idiomatic nominal as a possible subject and an experiencer formally coded as an object. In one particular Trans New Guinea language, Yagaria of Eastern Highlands, this is true only on the surface; other parts of the grammar reveal this experiencer to be a subject like any other. There is some evidence this mismatch of behaviour and form derives from an earlier stage of the language where the experiencers were unequivocal objects. This development from object to non-nominative subject meets the suggestion of Cole et al. (1980). There is, however, a significant difference from the instances previously described. This is the presence of noun-verb complex predicates. This has allowed the idiomatic nominal to be reanalysed as part of the predicate and lose its subjecthood. Thus this was not just a change in grammatical relations: the erstwhile transitive clause was reanalysed as intransitive and the experiencer, the only argument, as subject. Both these noun-verb complexes and the impersonals themselves are modelled in the formal syntactic framework of Lexical Functional Grammar (Bresnan 2001).},

I focus my attention only on those aspects of creole formation that result from the kind of cross-linguistic influence that has been referred to variously as 'substratum influence.' I argue that such influence is part of a more general type of contact-induced change that is brought about by imposition, a transfer type that manifests itself in a wide variety of contact situations not traditionally treated as involving the creation of creoles. I illustrate the workings of imposition in a variety of contact situations, including those that involve second language acquisition (including creole formation), and those that involve language attrition. I discuss two linguistic models that have been proposed for the description and analysis of such phenomena in creole formation, namely, Lefebvre's (1998) Relexification model, and Myers-Scotton's (2002) Abstract Level Structure model. I argue that these models are compatible with the view of imposition proposed here, and shed some light on the mechanisms underlying this transfer type, and how they produce the kinds of contact phenomena found in creole formation, as well as in cases of language attrition. I further argue that these mechanisms are essentially psycholinguistic in nature, and can best be understood in the context of psycholinguistic models of bilingual speech production. Finally, I suggest how insights from such models can clarify our understanding of how imposition produces the kinds of convergence phenomena we find in creoles and related outcomes of contact-induced change.},

However, given that the initial stage of processes of reanalysis is characterized by identical surface structures of the old and the new interpretation, basic methodological challenges arise for the identification of the innovation stage. Assuming that the notion of ambiguity and the relative frequencies of ambiguous and non-ambiguous uses play a crucial role, I propose a two-step methodology for diachronic corpus studies. The first task is to identify unambiguous switch uses, i.e. the first new uses which define the stage where the new structure has already been established. In a next step, a quantitative analysis of conventional uses and potentially ambiguous bridging uses can then be carried out in order to determine the strength of bridging use exposure (BUE) for the preceding period. Two case studies will illustrate the insights to be gained from such an approach which integrates fine-grained qualitative analyses of ambiguous and non-ambiguous uses in speaker-hearer interaction and quantitative investigations of the global frequencies of different types of uses in the speech community.},

The Poisson distribution is the canonical distribution for characterising count data with no or unknown upper bound. Given the prevalence of count data in linguistics, Poisson regression has wide utility no matter what subfield of linguistics is considered. However, in contrast to logistic regression, Poisson regression is surprisingly little known. Here, we make a case for why linguists need to consider Poisson regression, and give recommendations for when Poisson regression is more appropriate compared to logistic regression. This tutorial introduces readers to foundational concepts needed to understand the basics of Poisson regression, followed by a hands-on tutorial using the R package brms. We discuss a dataset where Catalan and Korean speakers change the frequency of their co-speech gestures as a function of politeness contexts. This dataset also involves exposure variables (the incorporation of time to deal with unequal intervals) and overdispersion (excess variance). Altogether, we hope that more linguists will consider Poisson regression for the analysis of count data.},

We present a new statistical universal linking speech with the evolutionarily ancient sense of touch. Words that express roughness\textemdash the primary perceptual dimension of texture\textemdash are highly likely to feature a trilled /r/, the most commonly occurring rhotic consonant. In four studies, we show the pattern to be extremely robust, being the first widespread pattern of iconicity documented not just across a large, diverse sample of the world's spoken languages, but also across numerous sensory words within languages. Our deep analysis of Indo-European languages and Proto-Indo-European roots indicates remarkable historical stability of the pattern, which appears to date back at least 6000~years.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews recent research using participant ratings to measure the iconicity (form-meaning resemblance) of words and signs. This method, by enabling wide coverage of lexical items and cross-linguistic comparison, has revealed systematic patterns in how iconicity is distributed across the vocabularies of different languages. These findings are consistent with established linguistic and psychological theory on iconicity, and they connect iconicity to factors like learning and acquisition, semantics, pragmatic aspects of language like playfulness, and to the semantic neighborhood density of words and signs. After taking stock of this research, we look critically at the construct validity of iconicity ratings, considering an alternative account of iconicity ratings recently put forward by Thompson, Arthur Lewis, Kimi Akita \& Youngah Do. 2020a. Iconicity ratings across the Japanese lexicon: A comparative study with English. Linguistics Vanguard 6. 20190088. They propose that, for most vocabulary, participants might rate the iconicity of different words based on their meaning alone \textendash{} specifically the degree to which it relates to the senses \textendash{} independently of actual form-meaning resemblance. We argue that their hypothesis cannot account for many of the various, theory-driven results from this line of research, which strongly support the conclusion that the ratings really do measure iconicity.},

Here we explore how context links short-term language use with the long-term emergence of different types of language system. Using an iterated learning model of cultural transmission, the current study experimentally investigates the role of the communicative situation in which an utterance is produced (               situational context               ) and how it influences the emergence of three types of linguistic systems:               underspecified               languages (where only some dimensions of meaning are encoded linguistically),               holistic               systems (lacking systematic structure), and               systematic               languages (consisting of compound signals encoding both category-level and individuating dimensions of meaning). To do this, we set up a discrimination task in a communication game and manipulated whether the feature dimension shape was relevant or not in discriminating between two referents. The experimental languages gradually evolved to encode information relevant to the task of achieving communicative success, given the situational context in which they are learned and used, resulting in the emergence of different linguistic systems. These results suggest language systems adapt to their contextual niche over iterated learning.},

  abstract = {Aligning on a shared system of communication requires senders and receivers reach a balance between simplicity, where there is a pressure for compressed representations, and informativeness, where there is a pressure to be communicatively functional. We investigate the extent to which these two pressures are governed by contextual predictability: the amount of contextual information that a sender can estimate, and therefore exploit, in conveying their intended meaning. In particular, we test the claim that contextual predictability is causally related to signal autonomy: the degree to which a signal can be interpreted in isolation, without recourse to contextual information. Using an asymmetric communication game, where senders and receivers are assigned fixed roles, we manipulate two aspects of the referential context: (i) whether or not a sender shares access to the immediate contextual information used by the receiver in interpreting their utterance; (ii) the extent to which the relevant solution in the immediate referential context is generalisable to the aggregate set of contexts. Our results demonstrate that contextual predictability shapes the degree of signal autonomy: when the context is highly predictable (i.e., the sender has access to the context in which their utterances will be interpreted, and the semantic dimension which discriminates between meanings in context is consistent across communicative episodes), languages develop which rely heavily on the context to reduce uncertainty about the intended meaning. When the context is less predictable, senders favour systems composed of autonomous signals, where all potentially relevant semantic dimensions are explicitly encoded. Taken together, these results suggest that our pragmatic faculty, and how it integrates information from the context in reducing uncertainty, plays a central role in shaping language structure.},

  abstract = {The packaging of meaning in verbs varies widely across languages since verbs are free to encode different aspects of an event. At the same time, languages tend to display recurrent preferences in lexicalization, e.g. verb-framing vs. satellite-framing in motion. It has been noted, however, that the lexicalization patterns in motion are not carried over to the domain of vision, since gaze trajectory (`visual path') is coded outside the main verb even in verb-framed languages. This `typological split' (Matsumoto 2001), however, is not universal. This article contains the first extensive report of verb-framing in the domain of vision based on data from Maniq (Austroasiatic, Thailand). The verbs are investigated using a translation questionnaire and a picture-naming task, which tap into subtle semantic detail. Results suggest the meanings of the verbs are shaped by universal constraints linked to earth-based verticality and bodily mechanics, as well as local factors such as the environment and the cultural scenarios of which looking is a salient part. A broader look across the whole Maniq verb lexicon reveals further cases of verbally encoded spatial notions and demonstrates a pervasive cross-domain systematicity, pointing to the language system itself as an important shaping force in lexicalization.},

At the same time, however, affect is complex and there is more than a single possible mapping from vertical spatial concepts to affective states. Here we consider a previously unreported case of spatial metaphors mapping DOWN onto desirable, and UP undesirable emotional experiences in Mlabri, an Austroasiatic language of Thailand and Laos, making a novel contribution to the study of metaphor and Cognitive Linguistics. Using first-hand corpus and elicitation data, we examine the metaphorical expressions: klol jur `heart going down' and klol kh{$\Elztrnm$}n `heart going up'/klol k{$\Elzopeno$}b{$\Elzopeno$} jur `heart not going down'. Though reflecting a metaphorical mapping opposite to the commonly reported HAPPY IS UP metaphor, which is said to link to universal bodily correlates of emotion, the Mlabri metaphors are far from idiosyncratic. Rather, they are grounded in the bodily experience of positive low-arousal states, and in that reflect an emic view of ideal affect centered on contentment and tranquility. This underscores the complexity of bodily experience of affect, demonstrating that cultures draw on the available sensorimotor correlates of emotion in distinct ways.},

Its frequency and ease belie its complexity. Every conversation weaves a unique shared narrative from the contributions of independent minds, requiring partners to flexibly move into and out of alignment as needed for conversation to both cohere and evolve. How two minds achieve this coordination is poorly understood. Here we test whether eye contact, a common feature of conversation, predicts this coordination by measuring dyadic pupillary synchrony (a corollary of shared attention) during natural conversation. We find that eye contact is positively correlated with synchrony as well as ratings of engagement by conversation partners. However, rather than elicit synchrony, eye contact commences as synchrony peaks and predicts its immediate and subsequent decline until eye contact breaks. This relationship suggests that eye contact signals when shared attention is high. Furthermore, we speculate that eye contact may play a corrective role in disrupting shared attention (reducing synchrony) as needed to facilitate independent contributions to conversation.},

The mapping problem asks how language learners connect a label to its referent. Mapping is one part of word learning, however, it does not reflect other critical components of word meaning construction, such as the encoding of lexico-semantic relations and socio-pragmatic context. In this paper, we argue that word learning researchers' overemphasis of mapping has constrained our experimental paradigms and hypotheses, leading to misconceived theories and policy interventions. We first explain how the mapping focus limits our ability to study the richness and complexity of what infants and children learn about, and do with, word meanings. Then, we describe how our focus on mapping has constrained theory development. Specifically, we show how it has led to (a) the misguided emphasis on referent selection and ostensive labeling, and (b) the undervaluing of diverse pathways to word knowledge, both within and across cultures. We also review the consequences of the mapping focus outside of the lab, including myopic language learning interventions. Last, we outline an alternative, more inclusive approach to experimental study and theory construction in word learning research.},

Sasak and Mandarin prove to have very similar frequencies of clausal IUs, but Sasak has far more complete clauses than Mandarin, which prefers elliptical clauses. Nominal IUs in the Sasak data are far more likely to be independent than in Japanese or Mandarin conversational data, and fulfill very different functions than those found in studies of Mandarin. I argue that cross-linguistic differences in the relative frequencies of different types of syntactic constituents are best explained partly in terms of the syntactic resources available in a given language, and partly in terms of cultural variation in conversational practice. Differences in the relative frequencies of various functions of nominal IUs, however, may relate more to genre than to language, but the limited corpora used in studies to date make this difficult to determine.},

Languages that are used predominantly for esoteric (intra-group) communication tend to have features that are semantically and grammatically `complex', while those used also (or even exclusively) for exoteric (intergroup) communication become `simplified' towards rule-based regularity and semantic transparency. Drawing on a range of contemporary data, we propose a psycholinguistic explanation for why esotericity would promote such complexity, and argue that this is the natural default setting for human language. This being so, it should be taken into account when modelling the evolution of language, for some of the features that are normally viewed as fundamental \textendash{} including the notion of fully developed underlying rule-based systematicity \textendash{} may, in fact, be cultural add-ons.},

  author = {Wu, Dr Jing-lan Joy},
  pages = {409},
  abstract = {This dissertation investigates juxtaposed verbs in Saisiyat, an Austronesian language of Taiwan. This language exhibits a pervasive phenomenon whereby multiple verbs, which share core arguments, are aligned in a sentence without explicit marking of clausal or phrasal boundary. Such a linguistic pattern gives rise to two questions. First, what is the syntactic status of these juxtaposed verbs? Second, which grammatical constructions do these juxtaposed verbs belong to? To solve these two questions, we want to reach the following goals. The first is to clarify interclausal relations of juxtaposed verbs based on Van Valin \& LaPolla (1997), Van Valin (2005) and Van Valin (2007). Three components of interclausal relations are examined, including semantic relations, juncture-nexus combinations and the interface between these two linguistic components, that is the interface between semantics and syntactic structures. The second goal is to classify these juxtaposed verbs into specific grammatical constructions on the basis of their interclausal relations and grammatical properties. Saisiyat exhibits two linguistic idiosyncrasies in terms of (i) the semanticsyntactic interface and (ii) the correspondence between juncture-nexus combinations and grammatical constructions. First, the majority of juxtaposed verbs examined in this dissertation represent the clausal and core junctures, and a minority to the nuclear juncture. Most of juxtaposed verbs display subordination and cosubordination, and none of them exhibits coordination. Second, juxtaposed verbs in the core juncture exhibit more types of constructions than the juxtaposed verbs in the other two junctures. Saisiyat cannot be viewed as a serializing language in a strict sense. Only a small number of semantic relations are expressed through serial verb constructions, while a large number of them are manifested in other types of complex constructions e.g., construction of verbal modifiers and complementation. That is to say, serial verb constructions are not a dominating feature of the complex constructions investigated in this study.},

I show that the five properties proposed by Matsumoto et al. as potentially correlating with the General NMCC are rather areal features which are falsified by the data of languages from Africa and Europe. The semantic interpretability condition and the syntactic licensing condition of the General Noun-modifying Clause Construction need reconsidering. Semantically, I argue that the interpretability of the General NMCC depends both on the semantics of the head noun and that of the modifying clause because they show close interaction with each other. Syntactically, I propose three general syntactic properties of the languages with the General NMCC, i.e. (1) no relative pronouns or relative pronouns in competition with a general clause marker, (2) complex subordinate locutions composed of the general clause marker(s) (and a head noun), and (3) unified verb forms in subordination.},

They also typically try to link observed F0 contours directly to intonational meanings. The PENTA model of speech melody presented in this paper deviates from this tradition. First, it makes a clear separation between the meaning-bearing components of intonation, which are functionally defined, and the primitives of speech melody, which are defined purely in form (i.e., devoid of meaning) and readily implementable in articulation. Second, it specifies mechanisms for concurrent transmission of multiple intonational functions. Third, it specifies a continuous link between articulatory mechanisms of F0 contour generation and the functional components of speech melody.},

Accusative-dative, a syncretic case largely attested in Sinitic languages, is also found in Bao'an and Tu, even if in a very limited use. The Sinitic languages have acquired this syncretic case marking through pattern reduplication due to language contact, while Bao'an and Tu have this innovation owing to the internal mechanisms of their language. The second phenomenon concerns possessor constructions in which the subject-possessor must be marked by a dative case. This marking is seen in all non-Sinitic languages in the Gansu-Qinghai linguistic area and has begun to appear in Sinitic languages. Multiple paths for borrowing between and inside languages in this area present an intertwined model of language borrowing. Linxia City and its closest counties should be the spreading center of these new syntactic devices, and Muslim populations speaking different languages may form a spreading net.},

  abstract = {The finding of consistent tone-segment alignment in many languages in recent research raises questions about the temporal organization of speech sounds in general. In this paper we explore the possibility that tonal alignment patterns can lead to the discovery of basic principles of temporal organization in speech. Based on a recent finding about the segmentability of approximants in English and Mandarin, we propose a general model of temporal organization, in which the syllable is the basic time structure that specifies the alignment of consonants, vowels, tones and phonation registers. All these sounds are unified under the term phone defined as a collection of unidirectional articulatory movements toward a simple or composite target. The phones are temporally organized by the syllable under three principles: co-onset of initial C and V, sequential offset of coda C, and full synchronization of tone and phonation register with the syllable. Under the time structure model, true coarticulation, in the strict sense of co-occurrence of separate phones, occurs only between initial C and V; and there is no anticipatory C to V coarticulation, no crossconsonantal V-to-V coarticulation, and no carryover coarticulation of any kind.},

It is an offshoot of 19th century Krio (Sierra Leone) and shares many characteristics with West African relatives like Nigerian Pidgin, Cameroon Pidgin, and Ghanaian Pidgin English, as well as with the English-lexifier creoles of the insular and continental Caribbean. This comprehensive description presents a detailed analysis of the grammar and phonology of Pichi. It also includes a collection of texts and wordlists. Pichi features a nominative-accusative alignment, SVO word order, adjective-noun order, prenominal determiners, and prepositions. The language has a seven-vowel system and twenty-two consonant phonemes. Pichi has a two-tone system with tonal minimal pairs, morphological tone, and tonal processes. The morphological structure is largely isolating. Pichi has a rich system of tense-aspect-mood marking, an indicative-subjunctive opposition, and a complex copular system with several suppletive forms. Many features align Pichi with the Atlantic-Congo languages spoken in the West African littoral zone. At the same time, characteristics like the prenominal position of adjectives and determiners show a typological overlap with its lexifier English, while extensive contact with Spanish has left an imprint on the lexicon and grammar as well.},

  abstract = {The presence of an intonational phrase boundary is often marked by three major acoustic cues: pause, final lengthening, and pitch reset. The present study investigates how these three acoustic cues are weighted in the perception of intonational phrase boundaries in two experiments. Sentences that contained two intonational phrases with a critical boundary between them were used as the experimental stimuli. The roles of the three acoustic cues at the critical boundary were manipulated in five conditions. The first condition featured none of the acoustic cues. The following three conditions featured only one cue each: pause, final lengthening, and pitch reset, respectively. The fifth condition featured both pause duration and pre-final lengthening. A baseline condition was also included in which all three acoustic cues were preserved intact. Listeners were asked to detect the presence of the critical boundaries in Experiment 1 and judge the strength of the critical boundaries in Experiment 2. The results of both experiments showed that listeners used all three acoustic cues in the perception of prosodic boundaries. More importantly, these acoustic cues were weighted differently across the two experiments: Pause was a more powerful perceptual cue than both final lengthening and pitch reset, with the latter two cues perceptually equivalent; the effect of pause and the effects of the other two acoustic cues were not additive. These results suggest that the weighting of acoustic cues contributes significantly to the perceptual differences of intonational phrase boundary.},

We studied the computations governing human motion structure identification in two psychophysics experiments and found that perception of motion relations showed hallmarks of Bayesian structural inference. At the heart of our research lies a tractable task design that enabled us to reveal the signatures of probabilistic reasoning about latent structure. We found that a choice model based on the task's Bayesian ideal observer accurately matched many facets of human structural inference, including task performance, perceptual error patterns, single-trial responses, participant-specific differences, and subjective decision confidence\textemdash especially, when motion scenes were ambiguous and when object motion was hierarchically nested within other moving reference frames.

Linear mixed-effects modeling of spontaneous speech shows that both tones have a higher F0 trajectory among younger speakers and in certain phonetic environments. Since F0 is known to lower with increasing age, for comparison we also analyze variation in the high rising tone (T45) and find no evidence of generational difference. This suggests that the effect of age on low tones is not due to physiological change across the life span. We leave open the question of whether this result reflects a change in progress or a stable sociotonetic difference between older and younger speakers. This study contributes towards two underrepresented areas of sound change research: (1) sociotonetic approaches to tone variation in naturalistic speech styles, and (2) engagement with Indigenous scholars who are cultural insiders in small rural minority language communities.},

  abstract = {A major goal of linguistics and cognitive science is to understand what class of learning systems can acquire natural language. Until recently, the computational requirements of language have been used to argue that learning is impossible without a highly constrained hypothesis space. Here, we describe a learning system that is maximally unconstrained, operating over the space of all computations, and is able to acquire many of the key structures present in natural language from positive evidence alone. We demonstrate this by providing the same learning model with data from 74 distinct formal languages which have been argued to capture key features of language, have been studied in experimental work, or come from an interesting complexity class. The model is able to successfully induce the latent system generating the observed strings from small amounts of evidence in almost all cases, including for regular (e.g.,                                a                 n                              ,                                                                                                                        (                         a                         b                         )                                              n                                                                                       , and                                                                                                                        \{                         a                         ,                         b                         \}                                              +                                                                                       ), context-free (e.g.,                                                                                               a                       n                                                                 b                       n                                          ,                     \,                                            a                       n                                                                 b                                                n                         +                         m                                                                                                              , and                                                                        x                                            x                       R                                                                                       ), and context-sensitive (e.g.,                                                                                               a                       n                                                                 b                       n                                                                 c                       n                                          ,                     \,                                            a                       n                                                                 b                       m                                                                 c                       n                                                                 d                       m                                                                                       , and               xx               ) languages, as well as for many languages studied in learning experiments.

The model provides an idealized learning setup upon which additional cognitive constraints and biases can be formalized.},

However, it is not known whether higher-order relations can also be learned implicitly. Here we present two experiments that investigate whether regularities, where items do not co-occur but instead share co-occurrence with each other (referred to here as ``paradigmatic''), can be learned implicitly. In Experiment 1, we used a traditional auditory statistical learning paradigm where participants passively listened to an auditory stream containing syntagmatic and paradigmatic regularities and found evidence only of syntagmatic learning. In Experiment 2, we instructed participants to attend to items during the training session and found evidence of learning paradigmatic relations in participants who demonstrated high-level of syntagmatic learning. The results are discussed in terms of the limits of implicit learning and the role of attentional mechanisms in learning higher-order statistical regularities.},

To overcome the limitations of previous studies, we used experience sampling technology to obtain test stimuli that have higher ecological validity and used pointwise mutual information to directly measure the degree of dependency in a formal way. Participants wore a smartphone around their neck for two weeks, which was equipped with an app that automatically collected time, images, GPS, audio and accelerometry. After a one-week retention interval, participants were presented with an image that was captured during their data collection phase, and were tested on their memory of when the event happened (i.e., week, day of week, and hour). We find that, in contrast to previous arguments, memories of different time scales were not retrieved independently. Moreover, through rendering recurrence plots of the images that the participants collected, we provide evidence the dependency may have originated from the repetitive events that the participants encountered in their daily life.},

However, it is unclear how different interferences change across development and what may cause the changes. To address these questions, we tested 4-5-year-olds (N = 103), 7-8-year-olds (N = 82), and adults (N = 70) using item and source recognition memory tasks with various manipulations (i.e., list-length, list-strength, and word-frequency), and decomposed sources of interference using a computational model. We find that interference stemming from other items on the study-list rapidly decreases with development, whereas interference from pre-experimental contexts gradually decreases but remains the major source of interference. The model further quantifies these changes indicating that the ability to discriminate items undergoes relatively rapid development, whereas the ability to discriminate contexts undergo protracted development. These results elucidate fundamental aspects of memory development.},

In the first experiment reported here, 4- and 7-year-olds were presented with paired-associate learning tasks requiring memory structures of different complexity. A multinomial-processing tree model was applied to estimate the use of different structures in the two age groups. The use of two-way listcontext-to-target structures and three-way structures was found to increase between the ages of 4 and 7. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the ability to form increasingly complex relational memory structures develops between the ages of 4 and 7 years and that this development extends well into adulthood. These results have important implications for theories of memory development.},

The similarity between mirative-like and contrastive-focus-like functions in the aforementioned languages is captured by the notion of something being brought to the forefront of attention. Mirative-like semantics are shown to be epiphenomenal to attentionoriented phenomena, and the functional domain in which the morphemes operate is shown to be attention rather than knowledge structure. The morphemes in the study are described in terms of three parameters, which are put forward as potentially useful tools for describing similar morphemes in other languages: speaker versus addressee orientation, clausal versus phrasal scope, and anaphoric versus cataphoric use. The first two parameters form a fourfold table in which the heuristically named ``mirative-like function'' has clausal scope and is speaker-oriented (i.e. speaker signals that something has come to the forefront of their attention). ``Contrastive-focuslike function'', on the other hand, has phrasal scope and is addressee-oriented (i.e. speaker intends to bring something to the forefront of the addressee's attention). Cognitively, contrastive-focus-like function is shown to establish joint attention.},

  abstract = {Phylogenetic trees or networks representing cultural evolution are typically built using methods from biology that use similarities and differences in cultural traits to infer the historical relationships between the populations that produced them. While these methods have yielded important insights, researchers continue to debate the extent to which cultural phylogenies are tree-like or reticulated due to high levels of horizontal transmission. In this study, we propose a novel method for phylogenetic reconstruction using dynamic community detection that focuses not on the cultural traits themselves (e.g., musical features), but the people creating them (musicians). We used data from 1,498,483 collaborative relationships between electronic music artists to construct a cultural phylogeny based on observed population structure. The results suggest that, although vertical transmission appears to be dominant, the potential for horizontal transmission (indexed by between-population linkage) is relatively high and populations never become fully isolated from one another. In addition, we found evidence that electronic music diversity has increased between 1975 and 1999. The method used in this study is available as a new R package called DynCommPhylo. Future studies should apply this method to other cultural systems such as academic publishing and film, as well as biological systems where high resolution reproductive data is available, and develop formal inferential models to assess how levels of reticulation in evolution vary across domains.},

  abstract = {Samoan is an ergative-marking, (reportedly) non-tonal Polynesian language in which ergative case is marked segmentally, but absolutive case has been said to be unmarked. This paper shows that in fact, a high edge tone co-occurs with absolutive arguments, based on converging evidence from the phonetic and phonological analysis of intonational patterns in the spoken utterances of a systematically varied set of syntactic structures. This empirical observation raises puzzles that probe the nature of the syntax-prosody interface and the relation between tone and intonation: what is the relation between this absolutive high edge tone and: (i) other case markers in Samoan, which are all segmental?, and (ii) other high edge tones in Samoan that co-occur with fronted expressions and coordination? I propose that: (i) the absolutive high edge tone is a tonal case marker that may be related to an apparently moribund stressed, segmental absolutive particle ["ia], (ii) the high tones that co-occur with absolutives, fronting, and coordination are all syntactically determined and each inserted in the spellout of distinct syntactic configurations, and (iii) there is another class of edge tones which reliably co-occur with pauses\textemdash intonational phrase boundary tones\textemdash that are not inserted in spellout but by the phonological grammar. While my proposal may seem surprising at first, I show that it fits the current data better than any alternative.},

  abstract = {Events make up much of our lived experience, and the perceptual mechanisms that represent events in experience have pervasive effects on action control, language use, and remembering. Event representations in both perception and memory have rich internal structure and connections one to another, and both are heavily informed by knowledge accumulated from previous experiences. Event perception and memory have been identified with specific computational and neural mechanisms, which show protracted development in childhood and are affected by language use, expertise, and brain disorders and injuries. Current theoretical approaches focus on the mechanisms by which events are segmented from ongoing experience, and emphasize the common coding of events for perception, action, and memory. Abetted by developments in eye-tracking, neuroimaging, and computer science, research on event perception and memory is moving from small-scale laboratory analogs to the complexity of events in the wild.},

Distinctive changes in the movement of objects or actors may contribute to the perception that one event has ended and another has begun. However, little is known about the quantitative contribution of movement information to the processing of events. This study investigated how movement features are related to the neural processing of events by performing functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants viewed simple animations of moving objects. After the imaging session, participants watched the animations again and segmented them into meaningful events. Movement features were systematically related to viewers' perceptual segmentation and to cortical activity throughout visual processing areas. Activity in the MT complex, which is known to be specialized for processing motion, increased with increases in the objects' speed. The perception of an event boundary was associated with transient changes in the MT complex and in a nearby region in the superior temporal sulcus associated with processing biological motion. Other movement features were associated with changes in activity in occipital, parietal, and frontal cortex. These results indicate a role for movement features in the perceptual processing of meaningful events, and in the neural basis of that processing.},

When people remember the events of their lives they depend on knowledge, some of which is in the form of scripts or schemata. Schematic information encodes typical patterns in events, and for this reason schemata often contribute veridical features to memory reconstruction. This process can be thought of in Bayesian terms, as incorporating prior probabilities based on recurring patterns in experience. It also can be thought of in terms of statistical regression, such that information from knowledge is combined with information from episodic traces to reconstruct a best estimate of what happened.},

New research indicates that segmenting ongoing activity into meaningful events is a core component of perception and that this has consequences for memory and learning.

This segmentation depends on the bottom-up processing of sensory features such as movement and on the top-down processing of conceptual features such as actors' goals. How people segment activity affects what they remember later; as a result, those who identify appropriate event boundaries during perception tend to remember more and to learn more proficiently.},

  abstract = {The intonational realization of utterances is generally characterized by regional as well as inter- and intra-speaker variability in f0. Category boundaries thus remain ``fuzzy'' and it is non-trivial how the (continuous) acoustic space maps onto (discrete) pitch accent categories. We focus on three types of rising-falling contours, which differ in the alignment of L(ow) and H(igh) tones with respect to the stressed syllable. Most of the intonational systems on German have described two rising accent categories, e.g., L+H{${_\ast}$} and L{${_\ast}$}+H in the German ToBI system. L+H{${_\ast}$} has a high-pitched stressed syllable and a low leading tone aligned in the pre-tonic syllable; L{${_\ast}$}+H a low-pitched stressed syllable and a high trailing tone in the post-tonic syllable. There are indications for the existence of a third category which lies between these two categories, with both L and H aligned within the stressed syllable, henceforth termed (LH){${_\ast}$}. In the present paper, we empirically investigate the distinctiveness of three rising-falling contours [L+H{${_\ast}$}, (LH){${_\ast}$}, and L{${_\ast}$}+H, all with a subsequent low boundary tone] in German wh-questions. We employ an approach that addresses both the form and the function of the contours, also taking regional variation into account. In Experiment 1 (form), we used a delayed imitation paradigm to test whether Northern and Southern German speakers can imitate the three rising-falling contours in wh-questions as distinct contours. In Experiment 2 (function), we used a free association task to investigate whether listeners interpret the pragmatic meaning of the three contours differently. Imitation results showed that German speakers\textemdash both from the North and the South\textemdash reproduced the three contours. There was a small but significant effect of regional variety such that contours produced by speakers from the North were slightly more distinct than those by speakers from the South. In the association task, listeners from both varieties attributed distinct meanings to the (LH){${_\ast}$} accent as opposed to the two ToBI accents L+H{${_\ast}$} and L{${_\ast}$}+H. Combined evidence from form and function suggests that three distinct contours can be found in the acoustic and perceptual space of German rising-falling contours.},

We distinguish between relative modality effects, where a linguistic structure is markedly more common in one modality than in the other, and absolute modality effects, where a structure does not occur in one of the modalities at all. Using examples from a wide variety of sign languages, we discuss examples at the levels of phonology, morphology (including numerals, negation, and aspect) and semantics. At the phonological level, the issue of iconically motivated sub-lexical components in signs, and parallels with sound symbolism in spoken languages, is particularly pertinent. Sensory perception metaphors serve as an example for semantic comparison across modalities. Advocating an inductive approach to cross-modal comparison, we discuss analytical challenges in defining what is comparable across the signed and spoken modalities, and in carrying out such comparisons in a rigorous and empirically substantiated way.},

Prototype copulas are typically of the form [NP SHI NP], are predicational or specificational, and cue information focus. We trace the gradual development over time of copula clefts in addition to prototype copula constructions. A key factor in their development is the use in Medieval Chinese of nominalizations in post-copula position. Copula clefts typically have the form [NP SHI XP DE] and cue both specificational and contrastive meaning. The study is a contribution to the developing field of constructionalization by making more explicit the way in which individual constructional changes contribute sequentially to constructionalization. It also demonstrates one way in which a complex contrastive cleft construction may come into being.},

The chance-adjusted indices are further organized into three groups, including nine category-based indices, eight distribution-based indices, and one that is double based, on category and distribution. The main purpose of this work is to examine the assumptions behind each index. Most of the assumptions are unexamined in the literature, and yet these assumptions have implications for assessments of reliability that need to be understood, and that result in paradoxes and abnormalities. This article discusses 13 paradoxes and nine abnormalities to illustrate the 24 assumptions. To facilitate understanding, the analysis focuses on categorical scales with two coders, and further focuses on binary scales where appropriate. The discussion is situated mostly in analysis of communication content. The assumptions and patterns that we will discover will also apply to studies, evaluations and diagnoses in other disciplines with more coders, raters, diagnosticians, or judges using binary or multi-category scales. We will argue that a new index is needed. Before the new index can be established, we need guidelines for using the existing indices. This article will recommend such guidelines.},

The second goal of this paper is to offer the beginnings of a positive proposal that seeks to show how the ontologically austere Davidsonian can account for the truth conditions of progressive constructions without the need for an enriched ontology.},

  abstract = {This paper explores a special pronoun, the locutor-referential pronoun tha in Zhoutun, a Tibetanized Chinese variant spoken in the Amdo Sprachbund. Two rules of the use of tha are found in this paper. Rule 1: If tha occurs in a complement clause of a speech verb, it refers to the internal locutor. Rule 2: If tha occurs in an environment other than a complement clause of a speech verb, it refers to the narrative locutor. If only rule 1 is followed, then tha can be considered a logophoric pronoun; however, tha is special in that it can also be used in the context to which rule 2 applies, a usage that does not fit the definition of a logophoric pronoun. The use of tha is not obligatory. An inherited form from Mandarin Chinese, the formation of the locutor-referential tha has to do with the contact with Amdo Tibetan and its probable evolving pathway is ``third-person pronoun{$>$} logophoric pronoun{$>$} locutor-referential pronoun''.},

  abstract = {Most global inequality is between-countries, but inequality perceptions have mostly been investigated within-country. Five studies (total N = 2149, four preregistered) show that Westerners (U.S. American, British, and French participants) believe that developing and middle-income countries' GDP per capita is much closer to developed countries' than it actually is, and that people in developing and middle-income countries have higher rates of car ownership, larger houses, and eat out more frequently than they actually do, meaning that Westerners underestimate global inequality. This misperception is underpinned by a convergence illusion: the belief that since the 1990s, poorer countries have closed the economic gap with richer countries to a larger extent than they have. Further, overestimating GDP per capita is negatively correlated with support for aid to the target country and positively correlated with a country's perceived military threat. We discuss implications for inequality perception and for global economic justice.},

Crucially, there does not seem to be a one-to-one mapping between particular formal features (focus marking devices) and focus, neither from a cross-linguistic perspective, nor within individual languages. This raises the question of what is actually being expressed if we say that a constituent is focused in a particular language, and whether, or to what extent, the same semantic or pragmatic content is formally expressed by focus-marking across languages. This special issue addresses the question of focus and its grammatical realization from a number of theoretical and empirical perspectives.},

  abstract = {Despite ample evidence that grammaticalization is accompanied by phonological reduction and ultimately morphological fusion, the latter process is remarkably less common in Turkish \textendash{} hence its prototypically agglutinating morphology. Since vowel harmony is a means of articulatory reduction, Turkish, as a vowel-harmonic language, therefore shows reduction but (virtually) no fusion. One morphosyntactic consequence of agglutination is that Turkish ``suffixes'' in many ways continue to behave like free words. To compensate for the resulting lack of clear-cut suffixes, vowel harmony and stress are co-opted to perform affixal functions such as the demarcation of words and encoding of relationships among morphemes. Due to the grammatical function of suffix vowels, however, even grammaticalized items must then remain at least monosyllabic, which constrains the extent of fusion possible. This situation suggests that theories of grammaticalization that do not sufficiently distinguish between reduction and fusion need to be refined. In addition, it highlights the need for language-specific analyses on the diachronic dimension and restores the status of morphological typology as a predictor of certain linguistic variables.},

The issue has caused Indonesian society and neighborhood countries curious, since Latin alphabet is world widely used as the most common writing system at present time. On the other side, the historical background of writing system's development which has been implemented sustainably through borrowing and adapting process proves that any writing system can also be used in other language society in the 21st century. Similar to that of the most of minority language societies, Cia-Cia language has not had its own writing system. The transcription of Hangeul in Cia-Cia language was begun to support the preservation of minority language. Concern to this issue, if the spoken language of Cia-Cia is stabilly continued, Hangeul will be known as one of the writing systems which has preserved Cia-Cia language in world's development of writing system history.},

This study is an analysis of such explicit certainty and doubt markers in epistemically modalized statements for a written news discourse. The study systematically accounts for five levels of writer's certainty (ABSOLUTE, HIGH, MODERATE, LOW CERTAINTY and UNCERTAINTY) in three news pragmatic contexts: perspective, focus, and time. The study concludes that independent coders' perceptions of the boundaries between shades of certainty in epistemically modalized statements are highly subjective and present difficulties for manual annotation and consequent automation for opinion extraction and sentiment analysis. While stricter annotation instructions and longer coder training can improve intercoder agreement results, it is not entirely clear that a five-level distinction of certainty is preferable to a simplistic distinction between statements with certainty and statements with doubt.},

  abstract = {The notion of polysynthesis was introduced two centuries ago and is still widely used in linguistic typology, as well as in linguistic theory and even language description. Nevertheless, several of its features make it unappealing as a technical term. First, there is no consensus as to which of the competing, partially overlapping, definitions is to be preferred. Second, the different structural phenomena covered by the label show variation both across and within languages; the term is in need of qualification to be precise. Third, neither the synchronic distribution nor the diachronic origins of the phenomena involved is well understood. Fourth, even though the term is essentially framed in typological terms, no robust cross-linguistic generalizations based on it have been hitherto found. The present paper surveys these features and argues that the notion can be used nonimpressionistically only if defined more cogently and more restrictively.},

The second is putting languages in richer cultural, historical, and political context. The third is including author photos in class materials both to combat stereotypes and as a self-accountability tool. And the fourth practice is integrating spoken and sign languages in our teaching rather than treating sign language phonology as a separate topic (or not at all).},

Since then, there have been a number of advances in the study of learning in higher education. To that end, the purpose of this article is to provide a critical analysis of three distinct yet overlapping streams of research in higher education, namely SRL, patterns of learning (including SAL), and student engagement. The theoretical bases of each of these approaches are outlined followed by a review of recent trends. Finally, an integrative model of student learning is proposed, which draws on the strengths of each of these traditions.},

The contribution of independent factors with different characteristic properties to pause duration needs to be explored.

We find that two independent factors\textendash{} the length of an IP (intonational phrase) preceding a pause and the length of an IP following a pause combine superadditively. The probability of a pause being short (\textcent{} 300 ms) rises greatly if both the preceding and the following phrases are short(\textcent\textcurrency\textsterling{} 10 syllables).},
